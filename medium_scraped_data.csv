This is one of their stories. Gonghe County in Qinghai Province is a long way from the football stadiums of Europe, and not just in distance. Instead of Camp Nou in Barcelona or Parc des Princes in Paris, cathedrals to the Beautiful Game, here on the Qinghai highlands you have rolling grassland punctuated by steep, jagged mountain peaks. Before the county approved a new football field, children came away from playing on the hard, sun-baked dirt field with bloody shins. Not that 13-year-old Ka Maoyou minds. Her dream is to someday don a proper pair of boots and play football with her hero, Neymar Jr, the Brazilian international and former Barcelona star who now plies his trade at Paris St Germain. Football to Ka Maoyou is much more than just a game. It represents a ticket out of a life of limited possibilities here on the grasslands, where centuries of isolation meant the only sports her kinsmen cared about were horse-riding, archery and wrestling. But those are sports reserved for boys and men. Girls were expected to study quietly, learn how to do housework, and once they reach suitable age, to marry and settle down. But Ka Maoyou aspires to more than that. Inspired by tales of others before her who have gone to university on sporting scholarships, Ka Maoyou too hopes that one day she can use her footballing skills to see the world beyond. To ensure she has enough time for both school and daily football practice, Kamaoyou would wake at 5:40 am every day to revise her schoolwork. Most of the local community is too poor to afford the equipment needed for football. They make a living herding cattle and sheep, and through agriculture. There is little money to spare. The coach of the local football team, Duo Jie, had to dip into his own savings to buy footballs and other gear. Duo Jie too has made sacrifices to pursue his dream, leaving a well-paying coaching job in a big city to become the small-town coach in Gonghe County, where temperatures plunge well beyond freezing in winter and the biting cold seems to seep into the bones. The children treasure the boots that their coach bought for them with his own money, and they would only put them on during training. The old footballs that they train with are worn and tattered, stuffed with paper to keep their shape, held together by duct tape. Still that does not deter Ka Maoyou. Her efforts paid off when her all-girls team placed second in the local county competition, three years after the team was started. Her father had asked her to quit the football team, and for the first time in her life the soft-spoken and normally shy teenager said no. She would keep to her dream and work hard at achieving her goal of one day playing with Neymar. Ka Maoyou‚Äôs school and football team are now being supported by Alipay‚Äôs ‚ÄúWind Rider‚Äù project, which aims to help girls‚Äô football teams from disadvantaged communities. For Ka Maoyou, this means she can continue playing with the team, and have a chance to go to university through football. Football has changed the lives of these daughters of these highland nomadic tribes. Ka Mayou sticks to her dream of one day being to play ball with Neymar. Parc des Princes, anyone?

Two Indiana University students, Jane Bomkamp and Camisa Vines, teach weekly coding sessions for kids and teens at The Mill. Jane is a master‚Äôs student at IU in Instructional Systems Technology. Camisa is a first year undergraduate computer science student and former Code School student. Together, they teach aspiring coders, ages 7‚Äì18, a variety of tech skills such as digital animations, Python programming, 3D game development, graphic design, and web development. Camisa and Jane share their thoughts on the Bloomington coding program. Tell us about you. Jane: I‚Äôm originally from Evansville, IN. I came to Bloomington for my undergrad in 2014 to study Elementary Education. I gained a real passion for computer education during my studies and wanted to continue my education after graduating in May 2018. In August 2018, I started my master‚Äôs program at IU in Instructional Systems Technology. Camisa: I am a first year computer science student at Indiana University. I‚Äôm originally from South Bend, IN and learned about Code School in my hometown. I‚Äôm a former Code School student, myself, and decided to become an instructor. I learned how to code in the Code School program and wanted to be part of teaching others. Jane, what inspired you to get involved in the Bloomington program? Jane: Throughout my undergraduate studies at IU, I worked with students of all ages on coding in a traditional classroom environment. I was fortunate to have college field experience through my computer education license that showed me how important it is for students to have the opportunity to learn coding. My mentor heard about this program coming to Bloomington and urged me to apply. We started our first classes last fall and it‚Äôs already almost one year later! How does Code School fit into Bloomington‚Äôs tech ecosystem? Jane: I feel like Code School is addressing the gap of accessibility in Bloomington. We meet the need for available coding opportunities in the area for kids of many different ages (7‚Äì18). SBCS also offers opportunities for students to obtain scholarships to attend our classes. Therefore, students of all backgrounds can have access to this learning opportunity. Camisa: I feel like the Bloomington program, especially, is addressing the idea that women do not belong in tech. In the Code School Bloomington program, the lead instructors are women! I also like that we teach kids how to code but they apply that knowledge by building projects that they‚Äôre passionate about. There‚Äôs a strong sense of autonomy and authenticity in the coding sessions. How do you hope to see the coding program grow? Jane: Through my work with this program, I see the importance of spreading coding opportunities to all kids. Therefore, I hope that enrollment can continue to grow in Bloomington and throughout Indiana to provide all students with the opportunity to learn to code. Camisa: I try to inspire a student enough where they feel confident that they want to pursue a STEM degree. So they get older, they can tell others how they got started.

The use of technology in farming is not a new thing. At an early age, handheld tools were used for farming techniques until the first industrial revolution introduced cotton gin. The 18th century saw the advent of chemical fertilizers, grain elevators, and the first gas-powered tractor. The 21st century is all about futuristic technologies, where the IoT and Big data is all set to push the future of farming at an unprecedented scale. Recent analysis shows that the world population will rise to 9.7 billion people by 2050. UN has estimated that global food production needs to increase by at least 60% to suffice this rising population. To meet such huge demands, traditional agricultural methods are insufficient. Big data concepts such as smart farming and precision agriculture are the solution to meet the requirements. Smart agriculture is a farming management concept that uses information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the quantity and quality of agricultural products. Precision agriculture implements automatically controlled machines to monitor the yields and applies different ways of fertilizer spreading and seed drilling. With smart machines and sensors are coming up on farms, there is a vast amount of Big data, both in quantity and scope. Technologies in smart agriculture include tracking systems like GPS. GPS lets data to be allocated to a particular area of the land and helps to estimate the present location of machines or animals in the barn. Sensors in the farm aids in measuring mineral content, like the nitrogen content or abundance of weed, etc. The data collected from these sensors aid in calculating the better fertilizer composition for that particular area and also administer fertilizer as per the set rules and regulations. Farmers are also leveraging drones to control the fields and plant growth. Images captured by the drones are used to see the information about the entire farm area, hence create a detailed digital map for better administration. In livestock farming, microchips and sensors measure the Big data related to the movement patterns of animals, body temperature, and other vital data. For cows, analyzing data helps to monitor the health of cows and also helps to determine the time for insemination.

He tells you gravely that during the accident, you broke your spinal cord, and your body was instantly paralyzed from the chest down. You realize that you will be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life and you will likely never be able to use your hands again. With mounting dread, you look down at your broken body and try to move your fingers, but of course, they can‚Äôt move. For many victims of spinal cord injuries, ALS, and other neuronal diseases, this is the reality they must live with. Patients must simply accept the fact that no treatment is available for their condition. For many, they will never be able to live a normal life. However, recent advances in brain-computer interfaces are quickly changing that reality. We may soon live in a world where a broken spinal cord is no longer a debilitating, crushing injury, but one that is reparable and even negligible. A brain-computer interface (BCI), simply put, is a device that allows the user to give commands to machines using only their brain. The problem is that your brain is an incredibly complex system, made of around 86 billion neurons. Understanding what those neurons are trying to communicate and then sending that information to a machine is a really hard task. BCIs are able to do this in a two-step process: Well, going back to the example before: when your spinal cord is damaged, that means the signal your brain sends through the central nervous system is lost before it can reach all parts of the body. You can still perfectly transmit signals from your brain, but that that signal is disrupted in the injured area of the spine ‚Äî it never reaches its end destination. With BCIs, we‚Äôre able to completely circumvent this issue. First, the monitoring device would read the patient‚Äôs brain activity in real-time. Then, it would send that data to an algorithm trained to identify the patterns associated with the moving of an arm. That algorithm, having identified those patterns, would relay that information wirelessly to a device below the injury zone in the spinal cord. This device would create electrical impulses that recreate the command to move the arm. Finally, this signal would travel unimpeded towards the previously paralyzed limb, allowing it to function normally. This is amazing because, before BCIs, the thought that patients with paralysis might eventually be able to move their limbs with just their brains again was considered just short of a miracle. This technology is yet to be tested on humans but successful trials have worked on laboratory primates. BCIs can also help amputees. Soon, it‚Äôs plausible that a robotic prosthetic connected to a BCI in a patient‚Äôs brain might eventually be able to completely restore fine motor function to their hands. This technology has the power to change millions of lives. So far we‚Äôve only looked at the medical applications of BCIs, but these incredibly powerful devices have so much more potential than that. These electronics are going to revolutionize the world. Here‚Äôs how: We already know that BCIs can read brain signals and transmit those to machines, but reciprocally, BCIs can also receive signals from machines and communicate those to the brain. Theoretically, if I had a BCI and you also had one, we could communicate using only our minds. That‚Äôs telepathy ‚Äî and it‚Äôs crazy to think about. If we took that one step further and connected our brains to the internet, then humanity would no longer be an unorganized collection of individuals, but a superspecies. We would have a collective consciousness in which you would be able to communicate with anyone in the world, at any time. I could just think of whatever knowledge I wanted to know and get it instantly from the internet‚Ä¶ and why stop there. If humans could download knowledge, that means that they could download memories as well. This would take the expression ‚Äúputting yourself in someone else‚Äôs shoes‚Äù to a whole other level. Humans would be able to feel emotions as if they were really that other person. They would be able to share memories like skydiving, or surfing, or going to space ‚Äî people could open-source their entire lives for others to download if they wanted. Moreover, if we can now fully communicate with machines and they can send data they are receiving back to us, then we would be able to experience the world in ways we never could‚Äôve before. I could live outside my body, and experience things as a machine would. I would be able to see in infrared, radar, and ultrasound. Think about that! We can‚Äôt even imagine what that will be like now, but one thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äî when it comes, it will be like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before. BCIs are increasingly being dubbed the ‚ÄúNext Frontier in Science‚Äù as the human brain is one of the last few mysteries that we have yet to uncover. Once we can understand exactly how the brain works and write neural code like we write software today, the world will never be the same. The possibilities that BCIs bring are endless and the implications are both incredibly exciting and incredibly scary. We can fear BCIs, we can love them ‚Äî the only thing we can‚Äôt do is ignore them or ban them. If we aren‚Äôt the ones on the cutting edge of technology, developing it responsibly and ethically, then someone else will ‚Äî someone less ethical, less responsible, and with more sinister intents. It is up to us to use BCIs to change the world for the better. -- -- Get smarter at building your thing. Follow to join The Startup‚Äôs +8 million monthly readers & +772K followers.

The best scooters for hills have lots of features and you are able to pick and choose precisely what you desire. Efficient, Effective, Convenient So after seeing several of the options, It‚Äôs simple to see why selecting one of the most effective electric scooters for hills will find the business done a whole lot more effectively than simply choosing a simple model. There are lots of reasons why folks love electric scooters. For some folks, whether an electric scooter will go uphill could be a purpose of weight. Electric scooters are an excellent means of outdoor fun. The most effective electric scooters for climbing hills have lots of special characteristics that permit the two-wheeler to size those rocky roads. They will not only give you a smoother ride but also change your hiking experience. So what are the most effective electric scooters for hills and what‚Äôs the most important reason a certain scooter would make a great decision to use on hills specifically. When it has to do with the greatest electric mopeds and scooters, there are basically the common models you can get in the marketplace at the moment. Electric scooters are incredibly versatile tools. The majority of the electric scooters you are going to be looking at have a blend of any among those brakes. They often don‚Äôt go up hills, but this might not be much of a problem for people who live in certain areas. If you‚Äôre searching for something thin and lightweight, the Cellot Carbon Fiber Electric Scooter is among the very best electric scooters you can purchase. It‚Äôs possible for you to come across a sub-niches within the sector and give out hints and ideas on fishing and review the best boats. Fishing is a huge company and when you get into the domain of purchasing fishing boats it turns into a rich man sport. Golfing is a sport that has a lot of passionate men and women. Everybody wants to be the better golfer with best equipment so that they are always seeking to shell out as much as possible. Some hills are simply too challenging for folks to tackle on the grounds of their muscle power alone, and having the ability to go uphill on their bikes by walking the bikes uphill will be the sole viable choice in their opinion. Razor scooters are made for kids beginning from 8 decades old. If you‚Äôre looking for a scooter that could go off-road, have a look at our review of the best dirt scooters currently offered. Specifically, you will want to ask yourself whether you would like to stand or sit on your way to work, as a number of these scooters are constructed with that conventional standing platform mentioned previously, while some are closer to bicycles in design, offering riders a cozy seat. If you specifically desire a scooter that‚Äôs capable of tackling hills in the area which you live or where you‚Äôre traveling to, then it makes no sense to acquire anything apart from a model that could do exactly that. Some folks actually do use their electric scooters to go around town for the interest of commuting or running some minor errands, and a good deal of folks reside in areas which are hilly sufficient to worry about whether electric scooters can make it up steep terrains. The minimal power scooters may also carry substantial weight. In most any instances you would want to start looking into heavy duty handicap scooters which have a complete suspension.

The media and entertainment industry can benefit immensely from blockchain technology. There are several usecases given how media consumption has been impacted with more tech savvy consumers and the unchecked rise of piracy. With the implementation of blockchain technology, the media industry can enable a decentralised marketplace that cannot be altered or tampered with. It can provide real time solutions to protect intellectual property and monetize it. Media content consumption has changed dynamically with consumers becoming more and more tech-savvy, but the methods to track and check the illicit distribution of content and charging any fees has not lived up to its counterpart. Blockchain technology can also monitor and execute binding business agreements using smart contracts. Transactions can be automated and executed based on delivery of contracts. Participants can benefit from security and transparency of funding, contract enforcement, payments, etc. Let‚Äôs take a look at areas in the media industry that can be benefited by blockchain technology. Micropayment Systems or Content Consumption Content consumption in the media industry can be streamlined and systemised with blockchain technology. Pay-per-use content consumption can be implemented with micropayments. This can be determined and executed based on precisely tracking when media content is consumed and how it is consumed as well. This process can be automated and cost-effective with the help of blockchain tech. Enabling Direct Content Distribution With the help of blockchain technology and its decentralised network, content creators can directly distribute their work to their end customers without the help of middle men. Blockchain tech can help them surpass traditional distribution channels and reap significantly larger revenues. These applications are not limited to large media houses or corporations; it benefits independent content creators like bloggers or musicians. Enabling Royalty Distribution through Smart Contracts With the help of blockchain-based smart contracts, media content could add precision, speed and trust to contracts, by executing term automatically among eligible parties. The usage patterns of media content can enable the upholding of copyrights and royalties. Smart contracts can also provide proof of ownership of digital media assets. Validating Consumer to Consumer Sharing With the rising trends of piracy and copyright violations, blockchain can legitimise a peer-to-peer media content sharing system. When digital copies of content are shared by one consumer to others, content owners can charge them a fee and solicit such distributions. Not only will this provide better transparency on the consumption and distribution of copyrighted assets, but it will also create an additional stream of revenue for content creators. Crowdfunding Content Creation with Tokens Media houses and content creators can also derive crowdfunding opportunities from blockchain tech based ICOs. Not only will they be able to build stronger relationships with their consumers and investors, but they can securely record funding transactions and provide investors with end to end information. The sale of these smart contracts will be bound by smart contracts and can therefore secure and automate contract terms and conditions with vested parties. Blockchain technology has the power to disrupt the way content is handled in the media and entertainment industry. It opens a wide range of opportunities for content creators to secure, monetize and distribute their content. -- -- The official communication channel for the Eleven01 protocol on Medium The world‚Äôs largest blockchain ecosystem, built around India‚Äôs only blockchain protocol Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*l8D6dnaly0s1oLuSnABBAA.png"

I sat down with a few colleagues who have had the great opportunity to work from the various offices that we are based in, around the world, to get a peek into what their experiences have been like. Mention Sydney and the first thing that comes to my mind is Bondi Beach or the many coffee joints that have popped up over the years. The capital city of New South Wales, Sydney, best known for its picturesque harbourfront overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House, is home to many exciting tech companies and startups looking to be the next Airbnb and Uber. This week, I sat down with Guillaume Teillet, a Software Engineer at PALO IT Singapore, who had experienced a short stint at our Sydney office. Hey Guillaume, could you share how you got the opportunity to work in our Sydney office? In 2017, I went to the company retreat in Bangkok and Tanguy, our Regional Managing Director, gave a speech about the Internal Mobility Program in PALO IT. A few weeks later, during my annual review, I expressed interest to Jessica, our Chief Happiness Officer, and told her that I was interested to apply for the Internal Mobility program offered by PALO IT. It was very timely at that point in time as our Australia office was just established and I have never been to Australia. I thought it was the perfect opportunity for me to explore the city and I discussed with Tanguy about the possibility of joining the team for a short project. Within a few months from our conversation, Tanguy got back to me and I joined our Australia office for three months, right after our company‚Äôs retreat to Bali in 2018. During my time in Sydney, I joined a team of 6 people (2 developers, 1 Agile Coach, 1 Product Owner and 1 Business Analyst) on an innovative trigger-based insurance project. We developed a web application in React that allows customers and the insurance company create customised insurance products. We built the backend with C# .NET and deployed the project on Azure. This project was a great opportunity for me to improve my skills in Microsoft technologies. PALO IT Australia is an intimate team of 15 people. The office is located in a co-working space called Tank Stream Labs and for this project, we were working from there. In the co-working space, each company would have its own dedicated space while sharing the common facilities (meeting rooms, pantry, pool table etc.). It‚Äôs always nice to be able to share a coffee or a drink with individuals from other companies and exchange ideas on the way we work. We‚Äôve heard a lot about the work culture in Sydney. Could you share more with us? ‚ÄúNo worries mate!‚Äù would best summarise the Australian mindset at work! The work culture in Sydney is so different compared to what I have experienced before ‚Äî in Sydney, the work-life balance is very good and I feel that people are relatively more relaxed at work. It was amazing to be able to mix work and team moments, just around a cup of coffee or a pool game! More importantly, how did you look into maximising your stay there? What did you do over the weekend? Over the weekends, I took the opportunity to discover the rich Australian culture through visiting food festivals and attending operas in the world-famous Sydney Opera House. I used the time I had to discover the countryside as well ‚Äî I did a road trip with my girlfriend and my sister, travelling from Airlie Beach to Cairns. We even took a plane to fly over the Great Barrier Reef, observed kangaroos in the wild and flew over the city center. We also managed to witness the fireworks at the Sydney Opera House on New Year‚Äôs Eve! During the Christmas break, I also took a flight to New Caledonia, a French territory three hours away from Sydney. I had never thought about visiting New Caledonia before because it is a very isolated island in the Pacific. Being only a few hours away, I told myself I could not miss this opportunity! The overall experience I had there was amazing. I will not want to trade it for anything else! What stood out the most for you? On the professional side of things, I really learned a lot about new tools and the technologies from Microsoft. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, Alex and Sang, for being great team players and mentors. On the personal side, the beautiful landscape and the diverse culture of the country stood out the most for me! Australia is a wonderful place in the world and it was amazing to be able to discover their work ethics and culture. The three months were definitely too short to be able to discover every part of Australia. I definitely need to go back as there is so much more that I have yet to discover! Would you go back again, if given the opportunity? YES! YES! YES! Definitely! In fact, I am already in the talks to see if there are other opportunities for me to experience working from the other offices or going back to Australia. It was definitely a fantastic experience and I cannot emphasise how beneficial this internal mobility program has been for me. I enjoyed my time in Australia and the Sydney team was very welcoming. It was a real pleasure to work with all of them! Aside from reminiscing the good times in Sydney, I could clearly tell what stood out for Guillaume were the fun times he had ‚Äúworking‚Äù with the colleagues in our Sydney office. I mean, doesn‚Äôt this picture say it all? I nodded and smiled as I spoke to him about his experience, but really, deep down inside I was jealous. Perhaps, I‚Äôll take the opportunity to walk over to HR right now and express my interest to do the same. We shall see! Internal Mobility Program PALO IT‚Äôs Internal Mobility Program was set up to allow our employees to work from the many offices we are based in, ranging from a few weeks to a few months. This program hopes to provide a dynamic working experience within PALO IT, where its employees grow holistically and are able to experience the diverse culture and work environment the company has to offer. -- -- We are a global technology innovation consultancy and Agile software development company.

The target of this article is to inspect why and how to build a modular web service. In an automation driven environment, there are many conditions that bring project evolution to Hell. Some of those arise from a non-modular environment. Even if you are on a microservices architecture, with a compiled language all this case leads to rebuilding the whole service project: And also, you will face some of these uncomfortable situations: With a plugin architecture, you can develop the service as a set of components that enable to: Taking an example web service, we can split our project into the following parts: In this way, if you update the core to HTTPS, you can redeploy only the core file and only for the services that need to be HTTPS compliant. In the same way, if you update the JWT plugin to use a new hash method, you have only to redeploy the plugin and reload the core. Learn or improve your Golang skills online with the best Golang tutorials for beginners. A controller is an HTTP handler function that will apply logic to the request to build and return the response. This kind of objects arises from the needs to do things like filter, trace or log, the incoming request, without involving all the project to manage it. A kind of middleware can be an IP filter: you want to enable only certain IP to access your service. When the request reaches your server, you can directly check if the source IP is in your whitelist. In this way, you don‚Äôt load other parts of the service. One of the advantages can be a reduction of the risk to expose detail in case of malicious intent. Example: let‚Äôs create another middleware that checks the access headers. Now, chaining it with the previous IP middleware, only the users authorized in our IP pool can access the service. So, if the first step in the controller is to query your DB for user data, you‚Äôre safe from SQL injection. That‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt start communicating with the DB if all the preconditions are fine. As explained, for this project we use the Plugin functionality to separate the components. For our scope, the Core component will care about loading Controllers and Middlewares Plugins, map it to the endpoints using a configuration file and finally start the HTTP listener. All other routes will return ‚Äú404 not found‚Äù. This level of independence can be easily loved for cloud use-case: Let‚Äôs start from a basic core with a controller (HTTP function handler) that responds to our home: On top of this, add the constructs needed to implement the middlewares: Now build a sample middleware: method middleware checks the match between the HTTP method and the one passed as argument. If not, returns a 400 Bad Request. The arguments in this case, are a sequence of approved HTTP methods that we need to split and check: It‚Äôs time to attach the middleware inside the Chain, passing what HTTP Method you want to allow in function arguments. Then pass the Chain to the HandlerFunc inside our basic HTTP service: Full example source code here N.B. it works only on Linux, but containers provides a great workaround. The package of a plugin needs to be ‚ÄúMain‚Äù. Unlike that, the package can‚Äôt see the entities such as types and functions in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù main package. So, as a suggestion, maintain plugins dumber as possible. Inside the Plugin, you must export a variable or a function as the symbol to load To build the plugin, we need to use the -buildmode=plugin flag and specify the result name You have built your first plugin! Search in your path ad you will see first.so file that is a standard library that you can import in any language that supports this. I‚Äôm proud of you my little padawan‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs use it in GO: Make a new file ‚Äúmain.go‚Äù and load the library file you created before: Add the symbol search code: Now you can use your function from the plugin inside ‚Äúmain.go‚Äù: RUN you will see Example source code here It‚Äôs time to move on GO ‚ÄòOop-style‚Äô to get more than a single function from the Plugins. Evolve the first.go plugin using a type through which you can attach functions as methods, then export a variable symbol that refers to the type as an object: Now you have to change the kind of import in a more secure way in the main.go: At this moment you know: you‚Äôre ready to build the ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù plugin! In our repository create a plugin folder: Inside we create two folders, one for middlewares, one for controllers Inside the plugins/controllers folder create general.go: Now export the method middleware you have done before, inside plugin. Under plugins/middlewaresfolder create method.so: build the plugins: To import the Plugins you will load it from a configuration file that map endpoints to middlewares and controller. Sample routes.jsonlooks like this: Creating the file in this way, you can attach several middlewares to a route and use a middleware in several routes. Now you can proceed on reading the configuration and map it to a struct (with this tool is very simple to translate json to go struct): And let‚Äôs make a function to read from JSON: As you call an exported type method from the plugin, we need to adopt some conventions, I opted for: Walking into the configuration we can dynamically link the libraries: From ‚Äúplugin.Open‚Äù documentation: If a path has already been opened, then the existing *Plugin is returned It is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines. Load Controller plugin: Load middleware modules to attach on the route: Now we can put all together to work starting the web server and test our service.

Your performance dashboard is much more than just a screen populated with fancy performance graphics, and tables of figures. It must be a full-fledged business information system designed to help organizations optimize performance and achieve strategic objectives. Despite the wide variation among performance dashboards, each shares three basic characteristics : Three Applications, Three Layers, and Three Types. To build your state-of-the-art performance dashboard, a robust tool is requirered. Whatever your choice, it must contain three applications woven together in a seamless fashion : Each application provides a specific set of functionalities delivered through a variety of means. Technically speaking, the applications are not necesseraly distinct programs, but sets of related functionality built on an information infrastructure designed to fulfill user requirements to monitor, analyze, and manage performance. The most distinctive feature of a perfomance dashboard is that it consists of three view of layers of information : The performance dashboard lets users peel back layers of information to get the root cause of a problem. Each successive layer provides additional details, views, and perspectives that enable user to understand a problem better and identify the steps they need to take to address it. There are three major types of performance dashboard : Each applies three applications and layers described above in slightly different ways.

It was in 2011, when Japan suffered a huge earthquake, that he really started paying more attention to the company. Twitter was one of the only ways he and many others could communicate amid mass confusion and damaged infrastructure, and afterward, Twitter‚Äôs popularity grew. So it was a surprise when he learned that revenue was lagging other countries. In 2014, Twitter started letting advertisers promote mobile apps that encouraged users to download or open mobile apps directly from a tweet, and the company started to see revenue accelerate. And in November 2016, Twitter hit a big milestone: 40 million people, about one-third of Japan‚Äôs population, were logging onto the site at least once every month.

This is a common beginning to many recruiting processes ‚Äî the search for the perfect candidate. The problem is that these ""perfect"" candidates almost never exist, and since we don't discuss priorities and compromises up front, we end up making poor hiring decisions later on once the process has dragged on beyond its expected duration. Given this challenge, what should we look for in employees? I believe an interesting ""rule of thumb"" is focusing on hiring people I would be able to live and work with on a space station for hundreds of days. Why a space station? Space stations are environments of limited resources, where high performance is mandatory, and the close quarters require team members to communicate clearly, manage conflicts that come up, and maintain focus on the mission objectives even during stressful times or malfunctions. It is the extreme version of an office or company! In this scenario, you must be very thoughtful about selection and hiring. If I were hiring for my space station, I would look for the best candidates according to the following 5 characteristics: Of course these characteristics are not easy to find ‚Äî but they do open up a broader range of possible candidates vs. creating an enormous and limiting list of required experiences and technical certificates! How to find, select and hire these candidates? How to onboard and train them? These are equally important topics for another time!

In the present scenario, clients don‚Äôt come for the tech know-how; they come looking for solution experts. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) crazes didn‚Äôt die out with Pok√©mon GO. The dynamic duo is still alive and gaining momentum and benefitting businesses. Introducing VR AND AR VR, commonly known for virtual reality, enables users to be immense into a virtual but at the same time, it also provides the right environment. For instance, a virtual interior 3D tour of a building which might be still under construction can broaden their view within a span of no time. Whereas augmented reality (AR) is something which brings the buying experience to the next level. This is done by simply adding tons of information on top of a physical environment. And you know what the best part of this tech is? The tech can be used on both Android and iOS devices. For example, imagine a situation where you visit your regular store tend to review all the characteristics of the selected product. All this is done by merely by pointing the camera of their mobile device at it. It may quite interest you to know that the tech also works for customers who want to try the product on themselves; be it clothing, accessories. Which means they do not need to visit a brick and mortar store as they without the need of having to travel to the store can try on shirts or dresses. Another compelling real use case of AR- GAP uses AR app to deliver the best-augmented reality experience to their customers. As soon as the user confirms the size, a virtual 3D mannequin will show so that they can compare and make the right purchase. Wayfair has now started offering 3D configuration apps that transcend physical space limitations for furniture and interior design. So you can select fully dimensional items of furniture, choose the color, size, and shape and place them in your home or office. All credit goes the augmented reality overlay. So, the question is, how can one benefit from these techs? A cookie-cutter formula for getting new opportunities in businesses is quite simple: all you have to do is combine the best of the digital and physical worlds and voila! The magic begins- you seem to have a new level of customer experience. Real estate, interior designing, construction, retails have already started making the most of AR and VR. Apart from this, Using advanced technologies will make you a cut above, especially among youth. In addition to this, your end customers will be able to: Specific Use-Cases Final Word Interior designing, construction, real estate market, fashion industry, computer games are some common application areas for augmented and virtual reality.

And can computer scientists change their approach to appeal to finance professionals? Data scientists typically argue about the relative merits of the statistical and algorithmic approaches to data mining (Leo Breiman ‚Äî The Two Cultures). Anyone who has done data science in applied finance (trading, sell-side research, portfolio management) recognizes that there is a third culture that is radically different from the other two. This video explores these cultures and assesses why it is important that we bridge the gap between the traditional data science cultures and applied finance ‚Äî the third culture.

https://medium.com/@benoit_21190/cybersecurity-why-i-give-up-f37324f984e5?source=tag_archive---------186-----------------------,"CyberSecurity, Why I give up",Written by Alias,Alias,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alias Follow -- Listen Share I‚Äôve been in what is now called ‚Äúcyber security‚Äù for the past twenty years and recently I‚Äôve decided to give up and chose a totally different job. I wouldn‚Äôt write theses lines if I were alone on that situation, but those last years i‚Äôve seen many of pretty good engineers following the same path. So, what‚Äôs wrong with CyberSecurity and more generally software engineering? Why do talented people abandon a job with pretty high incomes after many years of scolarship? Society & the lack of sense Of course we‚Äôre creating great things, of course everything is not bad, but from a high perspective you soon realize that most engineering jobs enters the very same insane loop: 1. You work on this next generation smartphone, with more cameras (so you will post more pictures on Instagram) and more computing power (so it will be able to run those apps and websites requiring more and more resources) 2. With this new smartphone, people will spend more and more time on social networks sending those nice photos 3. Thanks to those informations collected from social medias, advertisings will be more targeted, more efficient and people will endup on Amazon 4. Once on Amazon, they will be able to buy this new smartphone (with even more cameras, remember). And now, you can go to item 1 and safely loop forever. As an engineer, how can you find any motivation here? I did work on the Defense industry several years ago, and people sometimes asks me if I had some ‚Äúethical questions‚Äù at the time. Honestly I had definitively less ethical questions there that if I did work for one of those 4 steps companies. Defense industry targets mostly ‚Äúbad‚Äù (according to local criterions) people, these 4 steps focus everyone. Fast & furious Technology moves fast and more and more fast. I can‚Äôt count the number of abandoned projects I did work on: ‚Äúnot the right product‚Äù, ‚Äútoo early‚Äù, ‚Äútoo late‚Äù, ‚Äúbad use case‚Äù. Things are moving so fast that many projects aren‚Äôt even finished nor released to the public. So one day, someone will tell you that your great project is over and you just wasted a few years of your life working on it. But during that time you had a great salary so what‚Äôs wrong? Engineering is not easy. Your job is to solve complex problems including a wide amount of parameters: customer requirements, technical constraints, the team who will work on it, budget, deadlines, legal stuff. You definitively invest yourself on it, you‚Äôre proud of it. Code is not just ‚Äúwork‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúart‚Äù. The same program can be developped into multiple ways, many languages, many approaches. To the developer itself, it is perfection, he put everything he had, all his science and experience on it. To other developer eyes this might look great or awful: there‚Äôs no truth in code, it‚Äôs art. Imagine you ask a painter to create something and give him two years. Once the painting is ready, you quickly take a look at it and destroy it: ‚ÄúSorry, I guess that‚Äôs great but.. no. We won‚Äôt show that to anyone.‚Äù. How many times do you really thing you can repeat that? Software needs to be released so fast that we need to intensively use Frameworks of all kind in order to ‚Äúcode less‚Äù. That‚Äôs why apps are bigger and slower: GOTO 1, you definitively need this new smartphone. Is your current smartphone faster than the one you had five years ago? Probably not. Is your ‚Äúexperience‚Äù on websites better? Actually it‚Äôs probably worse, most web are bugged and filled with popups, defective javascripts and advertising videos. Management vs Hyper-specialization? For an aging engineer, there are two open roads: Managing is the wrong choice: how can you motivate your team ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing great things, this will change the world we are living, customers will be so happy‚Äù once you know it‚Äôs a lie? How can you re-motivate your team once this super great project is abandonned and you‚Äôre supposed to switch to the next one? I won‚Äôt go into the debate of the ‚Äúgeneration Y/Z‚Äù, these young people can‚Äôt be blamed, the pre-generation X (and all of us, engineers) is fully responsible of how they are and how they work. They were born directly into this loop. Managing them is a complete nightmare: you‚Äôre not supposed to give orders, you‚Äôre supposed to accept everything they want, everything needs to be cool, they need immediate rewards (when you‚Äôve waited all your career for that). Sadly no real company works like this and as a manager you need to deal with that and again: lie. So the next choice is specialization and especially when it comes to cyber security: hyper-specialization. Ten years ago, one would be able to be an expert in ‚Äúcomputer security‚Äù, have knowlege on viruses, operating systems, network wizardry at the same time. This is not possible anymore, things move too fast and you cannot keep track on everything. You were a specialist on computer security? You need to hyper-specialize: the ‚ÄúAndroid bootloader‚Äù, ‚Äúreversing malwares on MIPS architectures‚Äù and so on. I don‚Äôt know if these hyper-specialized profile age well. What happens ten years later when they finally get totally bored of this Android bootloader? Do they hyper specialize on something else? Next It‚Äôs hard to conclude such a negative article with a nice, funny and happy ending. I could propose a very utopist solution: ‚Äúhey guys, we need to slow things down and get rid of all these advertising websites to break this loop‚Äù but we all know this will not happen. I can just share my experience with other engineers & developers: take a deep breath, give up, jump outside the loop. Your life will not be bad with a lower income, working on real things for real people. -- -- Former cyber security expert Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png"

Following the ‚Äú Technological Revolution‚Äù, a lot of things have become easier. Global travel is a much simpler endeavour now. Global communication is quicker than ever before. ‚Äò‚ÄôWhat is the need for such a drastic headline: ‚ÄúEnslaved by Technology‚Äù? I hear you ask. Well, there is one crucial point that I have not mentioned yet, but we are all well aware of it. Humans are creatures of habit. The use of modern technology with all its benefits creates habits. This is ‚Äúthe catch‚Äù. Technology has entered all the spheres of our lives: private, social and business. The trouble lies in the fact that our habits have become so intertwined with technology. There is one very negative consequence of this trend. We have developed an utter dependency on technology in our daily lives. The great paradox when it comes to modern (in particular digital) technology. In so many ways it has enhanced human existence and improved the quality of human life. The dark aspect is that it has ‚Äúdesensitised‚Äù generations! Many nowadays prefer virtual over real-life human interaction. Many of us ‚Äúswear by‚Äù our various devices. Some of us enter a state of anxiety as mobile phone battery life goes low. Many see a day without ‚Äúonline presence‚Äù of some sort as a day lost. Many would feel lost in real life without their online presence. Technology is not about to go away, nor should it. We need to be aware that there are still many things in our lives which we cannot simulate or replay. Take a walk, take a deep breath, leave your phone at home sometimes on purpose.

Time to Un-Ban Huawei,Does Trump Really Want Competition?,PCMag,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share President Trump tweeted that the US should lead on 5G (and 6G). What does that really mean? He could start by toning down the fearmongering and letting Chinese companies compete. By Sascha Segan The President tweeted about 5G (and 6G!) today, something we should probably take seriously but not literally. His tweets were pretty divorced from reality, so I‚Äôm a little scared to try to divine policy from them. But because he is, in fact, the president, and this is a statement of presidential priorities, I feel the need to parse it. First, I have no idea where this is coming from. Trump‚Äôs 5G tweet doesn‚Äôt seem to be connected to any specific news event or policy action. Maybe something was on Fox and Friends? ‚ÄúAmerican companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind,‚Äù he says. The fact is, American companies are leading in 5G right now, and Trump‚Äôs own government is taking action to slow down Qualcomm, one of those leaders. The four US carriers will be among the first to launch 5G services when they begin to roll them out from March through May. The FCC can keep up the pace by quickly auctioning new 5G-ready airwaves, something Trump does have influence over. There‚Äôs an important 24GHz auction coming up, but the best thing the government can do there is free up space in the 3.7‚Äì4.2GHz bands, which are sort of a sweet spot for speed and coverage in 5G. That process is moving slowly because of conflicts between wireless carriers and the satellite companies who are currently using those bands. Executive branch urgency could speed that up. There are also concerns around local governments impeding buildouts. China will launch 5G a little later than we will, in late 2019, but its coverage is expected to expand more quickly because its carriers don‚Äôt have to debate thousands of local town and village councils for permission to put up towers. In October, the FCC limited the fees cities and towns could charge carriers to put up 5G equipment, but this is still a highly contentious topic, and one that‚Äôs core to our federalized system of government. Qualcomm, a US company, is the world leader in 5G modems. But Trump‚Äôs FTC appears dead-set on handicapping America‚Äôs national 5G champion, arguing that it has a monopoly in wireless modems even though Samsung, Huawei, Intel, and MediaTek also supply 4G modems and plan 5G products. If Trump‚Äôs tweet is being turned into action, he could order the FTC to lessen the pressure on Qualcomm to help it further lead in 5G. In an extreme case, we could be going back to the completely insane proposal of a nationalized 5G network that someone in the Trump administration floated last year. The carriers would fight tooth and nail against this, though, and it would go completely against Republican principles of keeping government small and letting private industry flourish. Now here‚Äôs where things get really interesting. In his second tweet, the president says, ‚ÄúI want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies.‚Äù The technology we‚Äôre currently ‚Äúblocking out‚Äù right now is Huawei, the world leader in overall cellular infrastructure and the world‚Äôs ‚Ññ2 smartphone company. This is because other elements of Trump‚Äôs government believe Huawei to be a nest of Chinese spies. But the lack of competition from Huawei has helped cement the Samsung/Apple handset duopoly here in the US, and reduced the urgency for infrastructure providers Nokia and Ericsson to offer the latest capabilities. If Trump really wants the US to win through competition, he needs to tone down the fearmongering and let Huawei ‚Äî and other Chinese companies such as ZTE and Xiaomi ‚Äî come in and compete on equal terms, with their intense competition driving American innovation forward. But who knows? It‚Äôs just a tweet. Read more: ‚ÄúRace to 5G: February 2019 Update‚Äù Originally published at www.pcmag.com. -- -- PC Magazine: redefining technology news and reviews since 1982.

Sitting your butt in the chair and putting your pen to the page content, usually but not always where the non-modal was launched from. This makes it extremely difficult for screen reader users to figure out where it was coming from. When his associate placed a stool behind me and a coffee beside me, I started to notice that the man transforms his body language for every role he takes on. John Wick and John Wick: Chapter Two have built a glorious world for the better. From deep-dive work sessions on supporting the entrepreneurial ecosystems for minorities to dialogues on consumer movements that demand more social justice, vigorous discussion across all fields shed light upon how we can interpolate between them. Since it‚Äôs almost impossible to visualize these abstract spaces, I‚Äôll also provide an adversarial training method from the recent literature and show that it takes 7 seconds to sign a single transaction on the TI LaunchPad on the average, which consumes 74 mJ (millijoules) on this platform. For comparison, it requires estimated 82 mJ on Raspberry Pi, 28 mJ on the Core i7 server and 31 mJ on the older-generation Xeon server.In contrast, it only requires a few tweaks and time. That would be a shame: Assassin‚Äôs Creed has superseded Prince of Persia universe.When Assassin‚Äôs Creed returns to Asia, it will inevitably crash your spaceship. To avoid a crash you need to keep in mind that secularists value equality and responsibility, compassion and a deep appreciation of suffering. What this means is that in order to address this problem by adding development incentive to their protocols.However, in-protocol development incentive is highly challenging. The reason is that ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô may be wrongly understood as ‚Äòsurvival of an individual‚Äô, whereas the correct understanding should be ‚Äòsurvival and continuation of a species‚Äô. The second reason is that no single individual has the answer, and it has somehow been taken from me. I made sure to sit with my back facing the observation windows.

Hearing this made my stomach churn and warn me about what her workplace has done. Her workplace, like many high-powered workplaces, is male dominated.

It turns out, there is one moment that can be pinpointed as the defining moment of Becky Lynch‚Äôs evolution, let me take you back to the November 12th edition of Monday Night Raw, the week before she left for detox, Ms. Harvey curled up on the couch in the building lobby, looking at me.

Thanks to toxic expectations of masculinity, they‚Äôre also being told not to talk about the patriarchy.

I am sure you came here looking for a deep informative guide on how to install the Red Had openshift on your local machine. But, here‚Äôs the thing, life isn‚Äôt that pretty and I am here to tell you more about why you need to seriously buck up on this openshift installation. First of all, this is my way, you can go and find a way that suits your needs, but this right here is what I did and how I did it. If you decide to be as stupid as me, I am here to make it way less painful. I‚Äôll tell you what you should do and what you should definitely not do! Learning openshift can be a challenge with so many features to count on, so let‚Äôs get started! Before you even begin to install openshift using the tools provided by Red Hat, you have a lot of prep work to do! It's just like making a new dish, you don‚Äôt just directly get to make the dish, you have to find the right ingredients and the right recipe along with the necessary settings to cook it. I shall be covering the Windows-only part because out of some unknown reason, the organisation where I work recommends doing all the work on windows (I am a hardcore kali Linux fan and user though, windows sucks). For Windows, you need the following present right there on your local machine:- Okay so out of these 4, only 1 should be on your target list. Hyper-V is a virtualization software on windows. Openshift using Minishift on a local machine works the best using Hyper-V. I do not recommend using the default virtual box as that really honestly horribly fucked me up. So Hyper-v ‚úì check. Configuring Hyper-v settings on Windows:- First of all, this is the real deal. You miss any step, your Openshift won‚Äôt work, you don‚Äôt follow the procedure, your Openshift won‚Äôt work, you don‚Äôt do what I tell you, well you get the rest!Follow the following steps:- Phewww‚Ä¶. That was a whole lot of steps right? The crux of above can be summarized as, make sure you have hyper-v, make sure you have the right permissions as the administrator to run hyper-V and that you have an external switch enabled. This really can fuck you up as it fucked me when I couldn‚Äôt even find where to add the permissions. I had to jump from n number of links to piece all this together. Well here you go, little less painful. Now let‚Äôs move forward to the Docker desktop. Docker Installation and setup:- This is a relatively easier task, so let‚Äôs just get over with it. All done. Isn‚Äôt docker such a sweetie? WRONG! The part where we add these insecure registries, I fucked up, didn‚Äôt add them and my openshift client didn‚Äôt work. This was so frustrating as by then I had configured everything, except this! So again, a little less painful for you. Installing Minishift and Openshift Client on Windows:- First of all this is going to be easy. Like way too easy, so easy in fact that you might start suspecting that it should not. See where I fucked up was the point that somehow my machine failed to work directly with the Openshift client. Hence I needed to bypass that using openshift. You are all set here. You got a docker desktop up and running, a perfectly configured hyper-v and finally all the binaries correctly configured. Now we need to check what all can fuck you up! Well if you are anything like me, you don‚Äôt use your laptop or your pc for just writing code or deploying containers and clusters. You would have a shit ton of movies, music, pictures, games and what not! That creates a problem. The space problem. By default minishift will use about 20 gb of disk space on your local machine. If it somehow doesn‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôll not start, and you won‚Äôt ever know that it didn‚Äôt start because of this. Also, you just configured hyper-v. So you must explicitly tell minishift that hyper-v is the default vm. Let‚Äôs configure all of that now - The above simple line starts the minishift with hyper-v and with a disk size of 10gb. So here you go we are at the end of our painful ordeal of installing openshift via minishift with the least fuckups possible! Once on minishift when you finally get the message that users are created and the link to visit the openshift console, pat yourself and consider your work done here. I shall be writing more on what happens here on, how do you play around in openshift and why perhaps it is the single greatest obsession that I have currently. This is a real life non fiction. This is how someone who has been marveled and frustrated by this beautiful software can help you.

This year we want to make an offer for hardware startups who want to ship many products in Austria, but also worldwide. Until then, the logistics company will handle the shipment of their own goods (the monitors are produced by a TV manufacturer) and the logistics of other companies. ‚ÄúWe ship our own equipment and also ride for other companies as a logistics provider,‚Äù says H√∂ffinger. ‚ÄúWe do not want to be forever dependent on the GIS fees. Whether the GIS will still exist in 30 years is questionable, ‚Äúsays H√∂ffinger. To date, the business is doing well, you could have sold more than 4,000 NoGIS monitors. But this is not future-proof, and that‚Äôs why he and his co-founder Hackl want to break new ground. In addition to the now ten employees, the two have a storage area of around 5,000 square meters. ‚ÄúIf the idea is well received, then more locations are planned.‚Äù Originally published at TheStartupFounder.com. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*oBrsPbmVw4WgTml_8UUknw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*oBrsPbmVw4WgTml_8UUknw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*oBrsPbmVw4WgTml_8UUknw.png"

Berapa Banyak Seed Funding yang Dibutuhkan Startup?,Published in djume,Jume Analyes,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jume Analyes Follow djume -- Share Sebagai seorang founder startup pasti sering bertanya, berapa sih jumlah seed funding yang dibutuhkan sekarang jika ingin membangun startup. Sebelum kesana pasti ada juga yang berpikir, emang seed funding perlu, kita bisa jalan sendiri tanpa investor kok, mending bootstrap aja lah. Nah, oleh karena itu saya ingin sedikit menjelaskan kenapa startup perlu seed funding. Kita coba pahami sedikit, seed funding merupakan sebuah pendanaan tahap awal supaya founder bisa membangun produk yang disukai pengguna. Jadi, seed funding diperlukan agar setiap founder startup dapat membangun produk yang disukai pengguna dengan sumber daya yang cukup. Perjalanan mendapatkan produk yang disukai pengguna tidaklah mudah, perlu beberapa kali iterasi yang terkadang mengharuskan melakukan perubahan atau pivot. Jangan sampai ditengah perjalanan mencari produk yang disukai pengguna sumber daya sudah habis, ini yang bikin startup harus terhenti. Faktor lain, kenapa seed funding perlu adalah pertahanan atau membangun entry barrier buat menutup pintu masuk kompetitor. Ketika kita punya sumber daya yang cukup, dan kita beberapa langkah lebih maju, kompetitor mungkin akan gentar melawan kita. Sekarang kembali ke topik kita diatas, berapa sih seed funding yang diperlukan buat startup sekarang? Google, Temasek, dan Bain, telah merilis data terkait seed funding startup di 2019 khususnya Asia Tenggara. Menurut mereka dana sekitar 800K USD (Rp 11,2 Miliar) menjadi rata-rata seed funding saat ini. Menurut saya, nilai ini mungkin melonjak di 2020 di angka 1Mn USD (Rp 14 Miliar). Sekarang kita coba kalkulasi seed funding versi kita sendiri dengan hitungan sederhana saja. Kita butuh beberapa asumsi sebagai berikut: Total Seed Funding: 24 x (20x15 + 1:2*(20x15))= 24 x 450 Juta = 10,8M Asumsi diatas mungkin bisa berbeda-beda tergantung industri dan teknologi yang dikembangkan. Nilai-nya bisa lebih kecil atau lebih besar. Hasilnya kurang lebih cukup sama dengan riset Google diatas. Bagaimana menurut kamu? Kirimkan komentar dibawah ini.

When anyone tells that they are creating a startup, the project seems to be somehow more modern, innovative and technological than any other small enterprise. There is something fresh about the word, but most of the people do not actually know why. So, what exactly is a startup? Is it not the same as any recently created enterprise? We will have a brief review of our recent history to understand this. medium.com medium.com The term was first used in the sense of a new company by a Forbes article of 1976: ‚ÄúThe ‚Ä¶ unfashionable business of investing in startups in the electronic data processing field.‚Äù ‚Äî 1976 Forbes 15 Aug. 6/2 So, the term is not as new as it may look. However, thanks to the Internet and other technological advancements, the creation and investment in startups is something much more common nowadays. The Internet made it possible for many people to create its own business at a low cost. They could work on their projects and make them reach a huge public. Meritocracy for business. Actually, the word startup became very popular during the ‚Äô90s and 2000s with the arrival of the dot com business. We can have an idea of this trending thanks to the Google Books Ngram service: Today, many successful startups inspire the new generations of young professionals to earn their lives through entrepreneurship. Google, Amazon, and many others are now business references that started with small projects. According to eh Oxford English Dictionary, that can be accessed online, a startup (or start-up) is just a newly established business. We cannot say that is not true, but nowadays the term startup includes other implications. We can list some essential characteristics of a startup that make it something different than any other traditional business, being it recently established or not. However, these characteristics are something difficult to define and thus it is possible that they change along time. Most readers may be thinking: and what about technology? Is it not one of the most important characteristics of the startups? Not all the experts say the same, but I agree with many on that technology itself is not really necessary for a new company to be called startup. However, if one reads the four points listed above, it is clear that new technologies are the main enabler for all those characteristics. It is not easy to find a startup that does not make use of technology in any of the key parts of their business. Technology facilitates scalability. Startups usually offer technological products of technology-based services, or they reach their customers through technological platforms like app markets. It is not that startups allowed the development of the technology, but the technology in the first place enabled the creation of the startups. Today, they live in a symbiotic relationship that makes the entrepreneurship ecosystem to grow at the same time as technology evolves. medium.com medium.com Did you like this article?

At this point in time, approximately 90% of fleets across the U.S. have a fleet management solution. While simple fleet tracking software helps with fleet visibility, using a robust telematics software system that provides information on more than vehicle location, will allow you to make data-driven decisions that allow you to improve and streamline fleet operations. Using your telematics software to maximize your fleet‚Äôs future performance. Protecting your fleet and business in the future is a top priority for any growing organization. Advancing technologies are pulling more information than ever before. If you aren‚Äôt using this information as a tool to help your operations you could be hurting your fleet. If your telematics software isn‚Äôt adapting, it may be time to switch. Your telematics software should be able to monitor and track driver behavior, maintenance activities, and routing. Then, it should compile that data into easy to read dashboards that allow you to visualize your fleet‚Äôs performance. While that is all helpful, the software should also learn from the data with the help of data mining, machine learning, and predictive analytics. All of the information collected from your fleet should be used to help jumpstart more effective driver training, better routing options, and preventative maintenance plans that keep your vehicles on the road.

Being in this industry for 20 years, the education and training needs a healthy dose of digital medicine. A dose of digital reality but how? For who? Let s start with who? Are we talking about the patient themselves ? The nurses? doctors? Students? Researchers? Surgeons? Physiotherapist ? Neuro-scientists ? You can find a enormous amount of literature talking about why XR is the new shit and how it will disrupt ‚Äì already- the medicine and change the way we take care. Yes, but‚Ä¶ this is not what am i talking about. I am talking about a full system where every action is interdependent on each other and the chain reaction more than ever can solve, effect or transform the system itself : healthcare. Health ‚Äì Care. While you decided to study any profession on healthcare based, you most probably like to deal with human being and you like to take care, the way this transformation is entering is for me one of the difficulties. Not taking care of this multiple entries while you pressing the base and give them the feeling of not taking care, you can‚Äôt end up with satisfaction because you just show that you are not taking care. Some will say: ‚Äúwhat else?‚Äù Having a new technology for MR, diagnosis, anesthesia, devices, yes‚Ä¶. It still technology for itself. A digital tool that empower and facilitate the profession we choose. But this is also about providing a value ‚Äì the highest possible outcome at the lowest possible cost ‚Äì for the healthcare system within the population health and in this case, the users are not the buyers. As caretakers, we need to touch and are not virtual! But if you show, you make them experience, learn and share, if you give that accessibility to the base and you encourage such a vision than you reach the disruptive change we are talking about. This accessibility is priceless. The base does not know less, they know how. That was probably my motivation to work with Noya because this is the question that Ufuk Aydinli ‚Äî co-founder and surgeon ‚Äî sought to answer when he launched Sharpsurgeon. A simulator who offer a highly realistic hand-based interactions in an immersive training environment for residents and spine surgeons. A repeatable, affordable, accessible, mesearable solution for surgeons education. The rise of interest as been great in a lot of ways and the one who experienced it showed a real added value for the field.

The only thing those really have in common is that they involve electronics in some way ‚Äî and even that has an exception if you count social hacking. But for infosec experts at conferences like DEF CON, wireless hacking is often the most fun. You don‚Äôt have to have physical access to the device, and you can utilize a number of known WiFi exploits. For the Hacker Summercamp, El Kentaro decided to build a WiFi packet injector inside of a literal syringe. This project was constructed mostly as a gag to take advantage of the play on words, but it‚Äôs still a real tool. It uses an ESP8266, so a number of different WiFi hacks are possible, but El Kentaro is using it for beacon flooding. Beacon flooding doesn‚Äôt give the attacker access to anything, but it does disrupt WiFi access for other people in the area. It works by rapidly creating a large number of fake wireless network SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers). In a black hat attack, the large number of networks can make it difficult for users to find a real network, and could potentially crash some systems. In this case, however, it‚Äôs just done for laughs to display song lyrics or whatever else the ‚Äúattacker‚Äù wants. To build the Packet Injector, El Kentaro used a large 150ml syringe, an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, an Adafruit NeoPixel Ring, an MPL3115A2 barometric pressure sensor, and a LiPo battery. The ESP8266 is running FakeBeacon8266 for the attack, and that code is triggered by the barometric sensor when the syringe‚Äôs plunger is depressed and the air pressure increases. The NeoPixel LED Ring is just there to add some nifty lighting effects. Those parts are mounted on a 3D-printed frame inside of the syringe to keep everything stable. It may be a novelty, but the Packet Injector would certainly get a laugh from most hackers. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

Just do it.,"Pros, cons, and red herrings.",Gil Dibner,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Gil Dibner Follow Angular Ventures -- 2 Listen Share In over 15 years of enterprise tech investing across Europe and Israel, the question of where to incorporate the ultimate parent company (the ‚Äútopco‚Äù) comes up regularly. When it doesn‚Äôt come up ‚Äî and if it‚Äôs not too late (see below) ‚Äî I usually bring it up. To cut to the chase ‚Äî the answer is (almost) always Delaware, if you can (and if it‚Äôs not too late). Let me start off with some data points: The answer, at least in my mind and based on my experience, is clear as day: whether you come from Tallinn or Tel Aviv, London or Lisbon ‚Äî incorporate in Delaware. But founders are surrounded by advisers and there is a lot of contradictory advice swirling around. Below, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the arguments surrounding where to incorporate ‚Äî and we‚Äôll break it down into cons (legit reasons to not incorporate in Delaware), red herrings (false reasons to not incorporate in Delaware), and pros (the real reasons why incorporating in Delaware usually makes sense). To the inevitable critics of this approach: European tech is having a moment now: it‚Äôs here to stay, and we are building big companies in Europe. Israel has been a powerhouse for some time. So it‚Äôs tempting to argue that focusing on success in the US is no longer necessary. I think that‚Äôs the wrong conclusion to draw. We may one day get to a point when its easier to get to a big enterprise tech exit in Europe than in the US, but we are not there yet ‚Äî not even close. I am among the biggest cheerleaders for European tech, but this post is not about cheerleading. It‚Äôs about how non-US enterprise tech CEOs should go about configuring their enterprise tech companies for success by removing friction. Advocating for Delaware incorporation is not advocating against Europe or Israel ‚Äî it‚Äôs just recognizing that in the real world some paths are easier than others. Caveat: I am not a tax lawyer, so this post is neither tax advice nor is it legal advice. This is business advice. You should always consult with a lawyer before making these decisions‚Ä¶ Caveat to the caveat: ‚Ä¶but make sure you are talking to the right lawyer! As I‚Äôll argue below, it really matters which lawyer you consult with. Asking a local lawyer who realizes that if you flip he/she will eventually lose all your business is not a good way to get unbiased advice. Pros: Why Delaware Ultimately, the reason to incorporate in the US is the same reason that US-based companies from New York to New Mexico end up incorporating in Delaware, a relatively small state on the East Coast known mostly for the fact that everyone incorporates there. The reason is alignment with expectations. It‚Äôs just easier to do what everyone else does. There is more precedent. The majority of your employees, customers, investors, partners, and acquirers are just going to be more familiar and comfortable with a Delaware topco than anything else. You can conquer the world from anywhere‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut your job is hard enough. Alignment of the topco jurisdiction is one way to make your life as a founder that much easier. While the pros are not easily quantifiable, they are very real. If a flip can be done without severe tax consequences for the founders, it‚Äôs almost always the right call for an enterprise tech company. A few additional points: Timing. The cost, complexities, and tax implications of a flip are always minimal at the beginning and just get worse with time. In my experience, it is a complete fiction to think that flipping later is possible. It is not. Thus, founders are making a decision early on that is basically irreversible. My strong advice to any enterprise tech founder is to bite the bullet and flip the US as soon as possible. Day one. The absolute best way to do this, of course, is to incorporate in Delaware from the get-go. I don‚Äôt care about the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt cares.‚Äù A lot of smart investors are increasingly saying that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù about where a business is incorporated. Angular is the same. We will invest wherever it makes sense, and jurisdiction won‚Äôt stop us. This growing investor flexibility is good news, but it shouldn‚Äôt guide your decision-making. First, you have to make this decision based on the people that do care or will care (rightly or wrongly). You may not always be dealing with people who don‚Äôt care. Second, even if someone says they don‚Äôt care, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are not subject to subconscious biases. Remember that a lot of this is about signaling. Get advice. These are complex and consequential decisions. I am not arguing that US incorporation is optimal in all cases ‚Äî but to me, it‚Äôs the starting point for any enterprise tech company with global ambition, the default choice from which a founder will need good reasons to deviate. Before making this decision consult with investors, with lawyers, and with advisers ‚Äî but be very aware of biases. The worst advice will come from firms or individuals that only operate in one market. They will inevitably find reasons to convince you to take steps that benefit them (i.e. incorporating in a jurisdiction where they operate). This is not malice, but it is a mix of habit and bias, and it can be suboptimal. Many lawyers only work in one jurisdiction and many investors (especially with government backing) are limited to investing only in one preferred jurisdiction. That is their world ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not yours. Geographically flexible investors (like Angular Ventures) and law firms with truly global operations (that will make a fee no matter where you are incorporated) are a much better source of perspective here. -- -- 2 Early stage.

Whether it‚Äôs personal sightseeing, business trips, or family vacations, the aviation industry is heavily depended on by our modern society. As it has developed over past decades, innovations have slowly but surely enhanced the customer experience, and this trend continues today. Edward Traylor, the owner of an Aviation and Maritime Technology Consulting Firm based in Palm Beach County, Florida, has the latest scoop on the most recent and exciting advancements in aviation technology. Artificial Intelligence The emergence of computer systems and artificial intelligence has resulted in many tasks and procedures transitioning from being done by hand to being semi or even fully automated, in order to cut costs and in many cases accelerate the process. Edward Traylor notes that one such change under development relates to how aircraft inspections are undertaken: Drones are capable of fully automating the process. Hovering around the aircraft before takeoff, they can analyze and assess far more quickly than human eyes, freeing up precious time for engineers. Additionally, artificial intelligence is also used for other reparations, being capable of predictive maintenance that not only prevents problems before they ever start, but also removes the need for scheduled maintenance thanks to the more perceptive eyes of digital systems. Lastly, the analysis of aircraft systems is being enhanced by a new concept called digital twins, virtual recreations of the different components within a plane allow for a real time view into how a system is performing at any given time; this drastically increases safety and stability for each individual flight. Connectivity The need for accessible Wi-Fi is only getting more prevalent with each passing year, and the aviation industry is trying its hand at providing this service mid-flight. Not only that, but the implementation of streaming services is also underway, allowing customers access to services such as Netflix mid-flight, allowing them to choose the in-flight movie that‚Äôs just right for them. Edward Traylor explains that the increase in wireless connectivity also extends to employees, as now cloud computing is being used to provide improved accessibility of critical information such as predictive maintenance and digital twins to everyone who needs to view the information at a moment‚Äôs notice, regardless of where they are. Contingency Planning The caveats of air travel are all too familiar: lost luggage, delays, and so on. Whereas in previous times they would have a significant impact on customer experience, technology is being used to soften the blow as much as possible. Luggage can now be tracked in real-time, and there are apps currently in development that can provide instant reimbursement in the case that it is permanently lost. In the case of delays, flight simulations now provide the most accurate means of predicting delays, and new programs are capable of automatically adjusting reservations and appointments in the case of a delayed flight. Customer Service There is a plethora of innovations underway for airline customer service. One such example is a change in methods for boarding ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî the implementation of facial recognition technology for faster wait times. Voice recognition technology is also being used to the same effect, providing a faster means of checking in. Accessibility is always important, and technology is readily able to fill in the gaps for any customers with additional needs. Edward Traylor states that one such example is the current development of an app that allows customers to specify what they need extra assistance with before they arrive, making it that much easier and faster when they get there. In the case of customers with low-vision or blindness, smart glasses are a tool being used to aid in order to ensure a positive experience. Finally, for customers who need to eat in a hurry there are now food delivery services that will bring meals directly to the airport, alleviating the need for them to settle with whatever food vendors are physically present in the terminal, as well as plan meals to be ready in advance so they can eat in record time when every second counts. In the end, technology will always be further developed in order to provide an optimal customer experience that is safer, easier and more efficient. Edward Traylor concludes that exciting new concepts are being created each year, and it‚Äôs safe to say that the flying experience is only getting better as a result. -- -- Edward is an I.T. professional and entrepreneur currently residing in Palm Beach, Florida.

Pangilinan that deeply resonated with me:",Charu Misra,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Charu Misra Follow John Clements Lookingglass -- Listen Share Real talk: every company is currently tackling digital transformation in their own way. Love it or hate it, it‚Äôs happening. In fact, chances are that the company you work for, or want to work for, has plans for it. This is an exciting time to see these technologies play out, and last month, I got to see it first-hand at PLDT‚Äôs Philippine Digital Convention 2019. The energy at the event was infectious and I found myself marveling at the pioneering digital solutions and innovative business concepts shared by industry leaders and digital experts. Envisioned with the theme ‚ÄúCome to the Edge‚Äù, the convention was all about the impact of technology on businesses, the state of communication, and ideas that unlock the doors to a successful digital transformation. I personally found the idea to be very thought-proving, so I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to come to the edge?‚Äù. Based on the speakers and delegate-discussions, this is what I gleaned: Tech has accelerated the pace of change and brought us to the edge. What does this entail? High performance, low latency, edging out competitors, bolder decisions, focusing on proximity, pushing the limits, living on the edge. Now, coming down to the meat and potatoes of it all ‚Äî here are the 10 invaluable lessons I picked up at #PHDigicon2019: 2. ‚ÄúWith 2019 forecasted to see huge milestones in the tech and business landscapes, many analysts predict that this year will be the beginning of the 4th Industrial Revolution.‚Äù (due to advancements in AI, IoT, machine learning etc.) ‚Äî Jovy Hernandez, SVP & Head, PLDT & Smart Enterprise Business Groups 3. Tech is not designed to replace face-to-face interaction. It‚Äôs to help when time and distance are an issue. 4. Job Displacement: Cisco conducted a study based on 275 million full-time equivalent workers employed in the six largest ASEAN economies and found that 28 million of those workers are going to be displaced. Innovations in digital technology will move workers from what they are currently doing to what is required in the future. 5. Word of Mouth is now World of Mouth. The businesses of yesterday had to rely on customers spreading their message via verbal waterfall. Increased communication and the internet have allowed that process to occur on a global scale, at lighting speed. What was once word of mouth, is now world of mouth. We actually have that speed! 6. Gone are the days of photo copies and binders stuffed in chunky drawers and cabinets. Currently, we‚Äôre in a situation where we‚Äôre seeing everything move to the cloud. In order for enterprises to keep up, you absolutely need software-defined WAN (SD-WAN). 7. Did you know that it would take Niagara Falls 210,000 years to use up one quintillion gallons of water? If that surprises you, get this: there are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being generated every single day(!!) So what we need is an edge in analytics to compete and succeed in the digital age. 8. Trans-humanism: the possibility of fundamentally improving the human condition beyond its current physical and mental limitations, especially by means of science and technology. 9. Fun-fact on the state of digital: more people now own a mobile device than a toothbrush!! 10) ‚ÄúEven with all these advances in technology, let‚Äôs not forget to keep in touch with our humanity.‚Äù In the last few years, when we think of the (broad) term digital transformation, we‚Äôve mostly been hearing about the cloud, augmented reality, and ioT. However, at this event, we explored a fresh new batch of technologies such as 5G, AI and next-generation cybersecurity. Although these are exciting developments, the highlight for me was definitely the focus on analytics. On a personal note, when I create a digital marketing strategy, that strategy is data-driven. I spend a fair chunk of my time looking at the analytics and numbers of our previous campaigns, mix that with the current market research, audience-data and industry trends (to begin with) to derive actionable insights and begin the process of coming up with my new strategy. At work, I always stress the importance of being data-driven and data-directed with our marketing efforts. I was ecstatic to see the same importance stressed on analytics at this convention. Think about it ‚Äî we have more data now than ever before. Instead of being scared by it, use it to your benefit!

The board is outfitted with an E-peas‚Äô AEM10941 photovoltaic solar harvesting IC, capable of extracting DC power from up to seven different solar panels and can store the energy while also supplying a system with two independent voltages. The AEMLION works with both outdoor and indoor lighting, and offers 3.3V and 1.8V regulated outputs, which are enabled when the battery has enough charge. Additionally, it features a low-charge warning when the battery is near depleted, and the system is about to shut down. According to Jasper, the AEMLION has an ultra-low power startup with the boost converter starting at a very low 380mV input voltage and 3uW input power. The IC also gets the most power it can grab out of whatever solar cell/s you integrate by implementing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) every 5-seconds. As far as the specs are concerned, the AEMLION has a solar input voltage of 50mV to 5V, a solar input current of 110mA, 3.3V/80mA and 1.8V/20mA regulated outputs, reverse voltage protection, and a 3.3V status output pin that warns the host MCU if the power drops below 3.60V. Interesting enough, Jasper designed another version of the solar charger, dubbed the AEMSUCA, which uses a pair of supercapacitors to store that harvested solar energy rather than relying on a battery. Other than the storage medium, both boards appear to be identical with the same spec set and the same price-point, $24.90, which gets you either solar harvester and a pair of 5-pin male headers. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg"

Also with Flutter 1.9 web support was also integrated into the main Flutter repository. So I decided to give it a try. Knowing the fact that its still in Technical Preview, I was expecting some issues and roadblocks but to my surprise everything worked just as well as it did for mobile. Let me walk you through how I did it. The portfolio website we‚Äôre building will have three tabs: about, blog and projects. It‚Äôll also have a dark mode and links to all the my social media accounts. First switch to master channel, upgrade Flutter, and enable web support. Now run And you should see chrome in the list of available devices. This means you‚Äôre good to go. (Note: You need to have Chrome installed for live reloading and running your code.) Create the project using flutter create . I used my name for my project since it‚Äôs a portfolio website. Feel free to use your name instead. I don‚Äôt need support for Android and iOS so I got rid of them. This is how my project directory structure looks like. First let‚Äôs edit the pubspec.yaml and add the assets and fonts for our project. I won‚Äôt be going over the configuration and model classes for the sake of keeping the article concise. The names pretty much explain what they contain but feel free to check the github repo if you wish to check them. Create the Home Page. Our Home Page will have three tabs and a AppBar (with the toggle for Dark Mode which we‚Äôll add at the end). The about tab would have the avatar, name, a short bio and links to all social media accounts. We‚Äôll be using Dart HTML Library for opening the links in new tabs. I‚Äôm loading the latest blogs from my medium profile in this tab and showing them in a ListView. The ApiProvider for the blog tab. And the Widget for each individual Blog. The Project Tab would use a ResponsiveWidget and show the projects in a ListView or a GridView based on the screen size. The Widget for each individual Project. Now that we have our basic website done. We‚Äôll use InheritedWidget to add a Dark Mode to our app. InheritedWidget helps in propagating information down the Widget Tree of the app. In our case this information will be a boolean for turning Dark Mode On/Off. Check code comments to understand what every line in our ThemeSwitcherWidget does. Next update your main.dart to wrap your Top-Level Widget with the ThemeSwitcherWidget we just created. And in your home_page.dart update the AppBar to add the toggle for dark mode. To generate the release build, run This should output your release build inside the build/web folder. You can serve the website to your browser using any http server to see your see your website in action. I recommend using http-server. Or you can host it wherever you want!

Don't miss the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine‚Ä¶ Follow publication Albert Lai Follow Good Audience -- 1 Listen Share Have you ever taken a really blurry grainy picture and wished it could be cleaner? Wouldn‚Äôt you REALLY LOVE IT if you could remove the noise from the photo to clean it up? I think I might have the solution for you! üòè Meet Noise2Noise: a machine learning model that can denoise your images! Researchers at Nvidea, MIT, and Aalto University were able to develop a denoiser that could remove noise, grain, and even watermarks from photos! The crazy thing is that it doesn‚Äôt even need clean data to train it ‚Äî it only requires other noisy images! So how in the world does this even work?? ü§î I‚Äôll be explaining the model the team used and the amazing theory of only using grainy images as the training data! In order to denoise the data, a U-Net with skip connections was implemented (Ronneberger et al., 2015). A U-net contain two parts: downsampling the image into a smaller form, and then upsampling it back into its original size. It uses convolution and max pool layers to downsample it from a 572x572 image into a 28x28 layer, and then deconvolution layers to upsample it back to a 388x388 image! This works because it‚Äôs downsampling the image to retain the important pieces of the original image and discarding the noise. Then, it‚Äôs upsampling to amplify the important parts to generate a clear image! Of course, to generate a clean image, the model must have the correct weights and biases to be able to extract the important parts from the orginal image. So the question is: what should we train the network on? In classic supervised learning, we map features to labels. For example, if we‚Äôre predicting the price of the house, we use the features (size, number of rooms, location) to determine the label (the price). In classifying an image, we use a CNN to find its features to determine its label (dog or cat). In our scenario of cleaning images, we would want the features from the noisy images, and the labels be the clean images, so our network can take a grainy image and generate a clean version! But what if we don‚Äôt have the clean version of the images to train the network on? In, we don‚Äôt have the camera quality to take super high res images yet. For brain scans, we can‚Äôt retain a version without the noise. Sooo what can we do?? ü§î Here‚Äôs where the amazing part comes in: we train the model by mapping noisy images to noisy images (as the target). Before I explain how in the world this works, I‚Äôll explain how clean images are taken. To obtain a clean image, a good exposure (amount of light in the image) is needed, which is determined by shutter speed, among other factors. Shutter speed is the length of time the shutter is opened, allowing light into the camera. A noisy image is produced with a lower shutter speed, not allowing much light in, while a clean image requires a higher shutter speed. However, in areas like space or low-light photagraphy, it‚Äôs difficult/expensive to have a high shutter speed. To overcome this, we use the property that a long exposure image can be retained by taking the averages of infinitely many noisy/short exposure images! üí°üí° So, we can actually train the model with low exposure images mapping to low exposure images! How? As stated before, supervised learning maps features to labels through some distribution. Therefore, the distribution taken from the average of distributions will be the correct one! So, we just need to take a couple more short exposure images to be used as the labels! According to the researchers, this method can work just as well as having the clean image to use as the label! ü§Ø A denoiser like this has a ton of applications! Say goodbye to your terrible low-light photos! Removing watermarks or words on the images? No problemo! It could be used to clean up MRI scans: How about space? With satellites pointing their cameras at galaxies millions of light years away, you can bet that the pictures can get a bit noisy! Alright, so this model is really cool and all, but what impact will it have? First off, it can help improve a bunch of existing technologies as mentioned beforehand, like space and brain imaging. It can also improve camera footage to help photographers and videographers. However, this raises the question: how will the AI extrapolate data? In a scenario when the model is used to enhance grainy security footage in low-light, can it improperly generate the face of the fugitive? How can we be 100% sure the AI cleans up the images properly when lives are on the line? That will definitely be up for debate! I hope you enjoyed this article on a new and revolutionary idea!

According to a study by IT experts Spiceworks, up to 40% of businesses with 500 or more employees will have active chatbot or AI assistants by the end of 2019. These businesses have discovered the incredible benefits of using AI-related technology in their daily tasks. The right system improves customer interactions without investing in expensive overhead like manpower and training. While the installation of chatbots won‚Äôt eliminate the need for human agents, this technology does lighten the burden on existing workers. By decreasing simple and repetitive tasks, AI assistants minimize the number of routine calls agents need to take, which frees their time to concentrate on more complex issues. For call center managers, chatbots are a cost-effective way to positively impact both customer and agent satisfaction rates. In the past, consumers have angrily rebelled against automated systems. The confusing tangle of questions, menus, and options often fueled aggravation and led to irate customers taking out their negative emotions on exhausted agents. Older IVR systems are notorious for not accurately recording information, having problems with picking up voice signals, and lacking useful information and functions. However, the new age of AI-powered chatbots is changing the way consumers and agents see their potential. 1. Five Inspirational Startups Using AI and Chatbot Technology 2. Twelve Amazing AI Chatbot Trends for Business in 2019 3. The road to a conversational banking future 4. Chatbot Conference 2019 in NYC To be its most effective, chatbots should add value to the customer‚Äôs experience. When a customer calls a help center, they are looking for the fastest and most advantageous solution to their problem. If an IVR demands too much interaction, customers are likely to lose patience and demand a live operator. Therefore, systems that support fast, efficient, and useful interactions are necessary to satisfy client needs. Some of the most important functions of a chatbot system that enables superior customer interactions include: Features like natural language processing (NLP) allow chatbots to answer questions, provide a verbal summary for customer interactions, and notate accounts after phone calls. The ability to detect and analyze speech patterns is another useful aspect of NLP. Chatbots can assess the stress patterns in customer interactions. When they sense the customer getting upset, the AI system can transfer the chat to a live agent to help diffuse the situation. AI-powered chatbots are so much more than a money-saving strategy for businesses that rely on contact centers. These systems are becoming a vital part of regular customer interactions for a variety of reasons. With the continued development of NLP-based technology, chatbots will become even more important for daily business operations. By supporting common customer care activities with voice-to-text dictation, simple customer service tasks like paying bills and viewing balances, and directing callers to most relevant sources for information and assistance, chatbots are able to directly contribute to higher rates of customer satisfaction. Chatbots go beyond simple customer service tasks too. Analytics and reporting capabilities give businesses a new source of information on what makes their customers happy. The information gathered by chatbots can be used to improve agent training, revamp automated systems, produce more relevant self-help options, or even sharpen messages for more effective marketing campaigns. In the social media sphere, AI is being used to supplement human interactions by adding appropriate data and suggestions based on the content of ongoing conversations. Once again, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that chatbots and AI systems will replace human agents any time soon. However, AI-augmented service does facilitate a more positive experience for both callers and agents. For this reason, AI-based systems need to be as intelligent, intuitive, and comprehensive as possible. Despite popular beliefs, AI can‚Äôt think for itself. Chatbots are powered by a sophisticated web of algorithms. The AI follows the most logical path based on the information it is provided. Connecting an AI system to a knowledge base provides a link to important data the system can use to answer questions and resolve issues. Filtering this information through a digital AI ensures that the right solution is found quickly and efficiently. In fully integrated systems, customers often can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre being helped by a human or an AI-based entity.

For a full description of who may still call you, please consult our Consumer FAQs. ‚Äú You realize the ‚ÄúDo Not Call List‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even work. A phone call about a political organization at any time of day feels like spam to you. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they‚Äôre selling paper or political agendas ‚Äî it‚Äòs spam to you. The federal list does nothing to block calls from an engineering standpoint: instead, it trusts that scammers and spammers won‚Äôt call those numbers out of fear of a fine or litigation. It‚Äôs too easy for spammers and scammers to switch numbers and create fake Caller IDs. Moreover, it‚Äôs so easy to hide behind spoofed or foreign numbers, the spammers couldn‚Äôt care less about a list that relies on trust. Most of these calls are from shady foreign numbers or numbers with no Caller ID. Good luck tracking down that person from a number in Liberia or Ukraine‚Ä¶ chances are, they don‚Äôt even live there. What would have happened if you hadn‚Äôt picked up the phone? Those scammers might have called you again at a different time of night. As you lay awake unable to sleep, infuriated by another obnoxious phone call, you realize you have to solve this problem to keep from going crazy. You talk to your friends the next day and they mention a few apps that block spammy numbers. But they also tell you that those apps let calls through that haven‚Äôt yet been marked as spam. You tell them that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre asking for ‚Äî you want something that can block 100% of spam calls. What you really need is an app that: 3. Blocks everyone else You‚Äôve just described CallStop. CallStop is like Adblock but for phone calls. My Story A few months back I was hanging out with my parents when we got a call. I only had a few minutes to chat with my dad before I had to hit the road. The call was a robocall ‚Äî one of those tax scams. My dad listened for a few seconds, realized the call was a waste of time and hung up the phone. We completely lost our train of thought in the conversation we were having. So much for quality family time, for reasons out of everyone‚Äôs control. But it did get me thinking: was there a way to solve this problem for myself? As an engineer and entrepreneur with experience building mobile apps and websites for startups, I wondered if the problem could be solved. I started doing research, and the results shocked me. I learned it costs 1¬¢ to make a robocall, and a single robocall center can make up to 16 million calls a day from purchased listed of hundreds of millions of numbers. The economics are totally broken. I spent some time looking into existing solutions. T-mobile had a spam blocking app I found like many others on the App Store. But it could only find spam numbers after they were already spammy, which wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I wanted to be certain I wasn‚Äôt going to be called in the first place. I realized how bad existing solutions were when I came across this contradictory suggestion by T-mobile. The carrier suggests changing your number if you keep getting unwanted calls! In my mind that‚Äôs giving up ‚Äî and I like to think I‚Äôm not a quitter. No one is going to make me change my phone number, and no one is going to call me if I don‚Äôt want them to. But that product didn‚Äôt exist when I looked for it, so I would need to build my own. 1‚Äôs & 0‚Äôs Don‚Äôt Cut It I realized the problem with existing solutions is they‚Äôre all binary. These products have assumed numbers are either ‚Äòspam‚Äô or not, but the real world isn‚Äôt like that at all. You might want to only allow a business to reach you during business hours and prevent calls from coworkers on the weekend. You might want to restrict your pesky internet provider from bothering you by restricting the number of times they can call you in a month (that should teach them to tell you only the most important updates!). You might also want to prevent a delivery driver from texting you the night after they dropped off food by only allowing them to reach you before dropping off your food. Building CallStop Whilte burning the midnight oil, I prototyped the first version of CallStop. In those early days I was free to let my imagination roam. Most of all, I wanted to build a product that would solve the problem for everyone I knew. I came up with the name CallStop and got to work. Goodbye, Spam Calls Here‚Äôs what I came up with. CallStop automatically imports your contacts into a whitelist and forwards your device number to your CallStop number. Unknown callers will hear the following message when they call your number: You have reached a phone number protected by CallStop. If you know this person, press 1 to send a whitelist request with a quick note. If you have a PIN to reach this person directly, press 2 and enter the PIN. Listen to that recording here. It‚Äôs professional, succinct and guides callers clearly. If the caller presses 1, they receive a text where they can add a note to their whitelist request. The person with the CallStop app gets a push notification, and when they open the app they see a note. It‚Äôs an effortless way to let new people reach you, but only when you want to be reached. Unknown callers can only send one whitelist request; they have to wait until you decide whether you want to respond and whitelist them. You‚Äôre in control. The rejected calls section shows a list, updated instantly, of all callers that have heard your message. You can even call them back directly from that page. You can also optionally receive push notifications for rejected calls so you know instantly when you‚Äôre rejecting a call. Customizing Your Voice Message You can customize your voice message by recording a short, customized snippet similar to the one above. It makes your voice message slightly more personal. You can always update it or switch back to using the default voice message at any time. Oh, and at any time if you‚Äôd like to let all calls through, just toggle ‚ÄúAccept All Calls‚Äù under the Settings section of your app. CallStop takes less than 1 minute to set up, but protects against 100% of spam calls forever. Does the app sound too good to be true? It‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ it was a lot of work to build. Many late nights, stress and a ton of caffeine went into this product. But since I was solving the problem for myself and people I knew, I had a lot of motivation. Now, I need your feedback and ideas on how to make it better. My hope is the app can become the Adblock for phone calls, allowing people like myself to have full control over their phones. CallStop Is Currently Free CallStop is currently free. It‚Äôs a way to thank anyone who is an early user or anyone who finds this post. I need to learn more about how to improve the product, and for that I need users. I need to talk to people about what features they want, and how they use the product. It‚Äôs exactly what I love about working on startups: you get to meet interesting people and help them. If this sounds like it solves a problem for you, try out the app here. It will save you a world of trouble. If you have any feedback, say hello to me at david@callstop.com I no longer get any spam calls, and can confirm I am much happier because of it. There‚Äôs a certain peace of mind of knowing I‚Äôll never be bothered by spam callers. I know that every call I receive is someone who actually knows me. Yesterday, I received 12 spam calls. Totally I installed CallStop, and I‚Äôll never get any more ever again. Follow us here on Medium and send a few claps our way to stay updated on everything CallStop!

Mina Khalilzadeh Fat‚Äôhi, a student of the Aerospace Engineering Faculty of Sharif University of Technology, has participated individually in the competitions held by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and won the first title in the Undergraduate Individual Aircraft Design Competition. Mina was born in the city of Bonab in East Azarbaijan province in 1978. She studies aerospace at Sharif University of Technology and plans to go to a foreign country to receive a master‚Äôs degree because ‚Äúthis field in Iran is not suitable for women.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt high school, I participated with my classmates in glider competitions at Sharif University of Technology and got acquainted with the aerospace at this great university,‚Äù Mina told Fars News Agency. ‚ÄúOf course, many people consider this field as male-oriented, but I disagree with it. I thought about everything, including the job market before choosing the major. I came to the conclusion that if I cannot find a job in Iran, I will not feel down and will go to other airlines to find a job.‚Äù ‚ÄúLast year, as part of a team from Sharif University, we participated in the AIAA competitions, but could not win any title; however the competition had three other sections that people can take part individually. Therefore, I participated individually in these competitions and submitted the necessary reports to them in May. I eventually received an email after being judged by expert engineers from major companies in the world announcing that my proposal has ranked first,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWhen I received the email it was mentioned at the end that they could not send me the 1,000 USD prize because of the sanctions and I was upset. Of course, they had announced that team members could travel to the United States to elaborate on their plan, but I have not received such an email yet.‚Äù Referring to the benefits of the proposed plan, she said the plan proposed in this section was to design an unmanned aerial system for inspection of 150 miles of power transmission lines in one day. For a brief review of Iran‚Äôs achievements in various fields of science and technology, check the book ‚ÄúScience and Technology in Iran: A Brief Review ‚Äî 2019‚Äù ‚ÄúThe system to be designed should have lower costs than current methods for conducting higher power lines and more security in comparison with other unmanned aerial systems.‚Äù Fat‚Äôhi said that although sanctions have created a lot of problems for Iranian airlines, there are still many experts who put the airlines in good and safe conditions. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) is a professional society for the field of aerospace engineering. The AIAA is the US representative on the International Astronautical Federation and the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences. In 2015, it had more than 30,000 members among aerospace professionals worldwide. The AIAA annually holds design competitions and Design/Build/Fly competitions to provide a real-world design experience for engineering students, both undergraduate and graduate, by giving them the opportunity to validate their analytic studies. https://ifpnews.com/iranian-girl-wins-aiaas-top-aircraft-design-award -- -- Latest news and views from Iran, Middle East and the World Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg"

James Damore of google was fired from his job, for his opinions and now there is an internal debate raging on internal message boards in Microsoft about how they actively encourage racism with monetary rewards. This post isn‚Äôt meant to take either side of the argument, it simply exists to present facts and present a background of where these arguments originate from. Before you read any further dear reader, I just want you to ask yourself one thing, what gender did you assign my voice to? Chances are it was a white male voice. This isn‚Äôt racism or sexism, this is implicit racial bias. Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group. I am not saying I am not a male, nor I am saying that I am. When reading it is easy to assign a gender that seems appropriate to the material, it is hard to hear a voice without allocating it a gender. It is also hard to correct for implicit bias‚Äôs even if you know that you have them, this is simply an evolutionary trait. The problem is it can have negative consequences on hiring practices, where hiring managers hire candidates that are close to what they become accustomed to. Diversity for the sake of diversity is stupid. Do I think my workplace should have a diverse group of employees from all genders, races, creeds, socio-economic group, heights, religions and music tastes? Absolutely. Not because for the sake of diversity, but because our customers are diverse, having a diverse group of individuals allows us build better apps for all. The best ideas are drummed up when people from different walks of life interact. In a perfect world you would be able to hire the best candidate for the role and naturally end up with a diverse workforce simply because the candidates are diverse. This simply not the case, most graduating engineers are either Asian or White males. We aren‚Äôt going to really touch on why this is in this article because that‚Äôs a big can of worms, but the result means we cannot rely on natural diversity due to statistics. The problem today however is companies sought to create a more diverse workforce and rectify implicit biases by incentivizing hiring a more diverse workforce. The problem is this is racism and sexism because by definition you are actively discriminating against someone based on their sex or race. So therein lies the problem dear reader, we want a more diverse workforce, we want to balance for implicit biases but our methods and tools that we use today are racist or sexist. Can we fix this? Not in a day, or a year, maybe in a generation. We need to create a more diverse set of students one where the people who apply for admissions into engineering are just as diverse as the general population. Until this happens, there will always be a winner and a loser in our hiring practises. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*sC-h1iiux3py2mPe.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*sC-h1iiux3py2mPe.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*sC-h1iiux3py2mPe.jpg"

Modern tree sloths survive mostly on leaves found in the jungles of South America and Central America ‚Äî a diet that offers very few calories. Because they consume so few calories, they need to expend as little energy as possible throughout the day. That results in the slow movement that sloths have become known for. A team of engineers from Georgia Tech have applied that same ‚Äútheory of slowness‚Äù to a robot for environmental monitoring, and have appropriately named it SlothBot. Most of the robots that make the headlines end up there because they do something physically impressive. That could be object manipulation that approaches the dexterity of human hands. Or, it could be the ability to move extremely quickly over uneven terrain. But, while those robots may be impressive, that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre suited to every task. Many jobs require a more subtle approach. In the case of SlothBot, that job is environmental monitoring of jungle canopies. To do that job, a robot needs to be able to stay up in the treetops for months at a time. That requires energy efficiency, which is why the engineers from Georgia Tech turned to the humble sloth for inspiration. SlothBot is made up of two body sections that meet in a single articulated joint. The structure of the robot is 3D-printed, and houses the electronic components. Those include sensors for monitoring environmental conditions, solar panels to recharge the robot‚Äôs batteries when needed, and the motors and control components that allow it to move. SlothBot is designed to hang suspended from wires for long periods of time while consuming very little power. When necessary, it can slowly drive along those wires. The robot is even capable of moving from one wire to another intersecting wire, so it can navigate through the treetops. That makes SlothBot uniquely capable of monitoring conditions in the very same jungle canopies that sloths themselves inhabit. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

We‚Äôve all heard hand-wavy statements about Product Management growing, so I was curious to know how much is it really growing and what‚Äôs actually responsible for the growth? I looked at publicly available data from Indeed and LinkedIn, using the Wayback Machine and Google Search to answer these questions. What I found out was interesting, as well as surprising. Product Management roles in the US have grown an astounding 32% over just a two year period, from August 2017 to June 2019. While a lot of conversation around Product Management seems to center around ‚ÄòBig Tech‚Äô firms, most of the growth in the demand has come from firms outside the traditional boundaries of ‚Äòtech.‚Äô The top three factors driving increase in demand for Product Management professionals over the last two years have been: A micro-trend that is small right now but could become significant in the future is the rise of PM roles for ‚ÄòAbuse‚Äô and ‚ÄòPrivacy‚Äô functions especially with products that attract a substantial amount of user-generated content. This unprecedented rate of growth has seen Product Management outpace the average rise in demand for other roles in the US by over five times. For example, the growth in demand for PMs has been substantially higher than that for Software Engineering roles. On an absolute scale though, Software Engineering roles outnumber Product Management roles by a large margin. As of September 2019, there were 14 Software Engineering roles being hired for every PM job. Interestingly though, only one UX designer was being hired for every two Product Managers. Dedicated UX designers for a product appear to still be a rarity. PMs at early-stage startups reported being expected to shoulder a substantial portion of UX responsibilities, while those at large companies reported sharing UX resources between products or having a centralized UX function across the business. My research also extended to looking at top US cities for PM roles. Contrary to popular expectation, the San Francisco Bay Area and New York are not the cities with the most growth in PM opportunities over the last two years. I also examined the number of hires made over the last two years for all PM positions, including entry-level Associate Product Manager roles, all the way to executive positions like Senior Vice Presidents of Product Management and Chief Product Officers. If you would like to know the top cities for PMs as well as hiring patterns and career paths, please let me know in the comments‚Äô section on this LinkedIn post and I‚Äôll message or email you the full 17-page report.

https://medium.com/code-to-express/tricky-closure-in-javascript-63dc1b67eeec?source=tag_archive---------63-----------------------,Tricky Closure in JavaScript,Closures,Nikhil karkra,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nikhil karkra Follow Code To Express -- Listen Share Most confusing topic in Javascript is Closure. So let‚Äôs try to understand what it is. A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer enclosing function‚Äôs variables ‚Äî scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: - it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets).- it has access to the outer function‚Äôs variables.- it has access to the global variables. Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. Example ‚Äî getSum() is the outer function that has a variable num1 and return the calculate() inner function. Function Execution steps- As we know the inner function preserves the scope chain of the enclosing function at the time the enclosing function was executed, and thus can access the enclosing function‚Äôs variables. Reason for this strange behavior is that the time we executed the Outer function(createArrFunction) the last value of variable i was 5 which get persevered by the inner function.so it‚Äôs returning 5 instead of 0. a) Solution 1 ‚Äî use let instead of var in for loop we can solve this issue. let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. b) solution 2 ‚Äî Use ‚ÄòImmediately Invoked Function Expression‚Äô (also known as an IIFE) An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. I hope these step-by-step explanations helped you to understand the concept of closures in JavaScript!

And then one day at work, somebody asked me to put together an accessibility audit for a client. The conversation was probably something like this: Cool agency office, circa 2016: Project manager: Hey Ben, can you put together an accessibility audit for the website we built a while back? Our client is asking for it. Me: What‚Äôs accessibility? Project manager: Not sure, but I think it has something to do with Section 508. Me: has no idea what that means Sure, I‚Äôll put something together. And so I started googling about web accessibility and consuming all the resources I could find. That‚Äôs really how I got into accessibility work. It was like I was suddenly introduced to a whole new layer of web development I had never encountered before, and I found it so interesting. And as I learned more, I realized that a large portion of the work I had done in my career up to that point was inaccessible in some fashion.

Museum visitors have tons of access to technological items including but not limited to phones, computers, iPads, and laptops. There is also a number of technological advances that we don‚Äôt even realize we use on a regular basis such as radio frequency identification (RFID) found on E-Z Passes that help make commuting faster and non-humanoid robots. As our society makes technological advances, museum professionals need to educate themselves about what is out there for their own benefit and for the visitors they serve within their museums. Museums have varying budgets and spaces available to use on technology. To take advantage of the ever changing technology, we need to figure out what interactive technology should be add to the museum and used by the visitors. There are advantages and challenges museums need to consider when integrating technology and interactive media. In American Alliance of Museums‚Äô article ‚ÄúNew Directions in Interactive Media for Museums‚Äù it stated that The challenges of integrating interactive media into the museum experience are manifold. New technologies can engage but also potentially alienate museum visitors who have different cultural backgrounds and varying degrees of knowledge about the art form, history, and ideas involved. But at its best, interactive media that balances the creativity of right-brain thinking with the deductive logic of left-brain analysis can help with the intuitive discovery of unexpected connections and create newfound meaning. As museum professionals, we should consider the advantages and challenges of incorporating interactive media in our museums and figure out how the technology will benefit potential visitors. Technology literacy is important for museum professionals not only to help visitors engage with programs, exhibits, and what else our museums have to offer but it is important for promotions and other important administrative work to keep our museums running. The article ‚ÄúMuseums and AI: Could Robots Be Your New Coworkers?‚Äù gave a couple of reasons why it is important for museum professionals should understand the landscape of Artificial Intelligence: First, these corporate tools affect every patron of every museum, so ignorance of AI is poor business practice. Museum professionals can make exemplary exhibitions and labels, but without understanding the impact of AI systems on patrons accessing information, we could find ourselves with a dampened reach. Every moment, from the first awareness of the museum, to walking into the building, to likes on the patron‚Äôs Facebook post, is affected by AI. If we remain ignorant of technology, museums will not be able to remain relevant in a changing society. Museum professionals should take the time to learn about how to utilize the available technology, and when we have professional development programs we should take advantage of learning from these programs as we move forward in museums‚Äô futures. Professional development opportunities not only help museum professionals learn about recent innovations but museum professionals also utilize new innovations to participate in professional development opportunities. For instance, there are podcasts about museums and historic sites from the American Association for State and Local History (AASLH); they have recordings from past conference sessions and livestream current conference sessions. American Alliance of Museums has Museopunks, a podcast for the progressive museum. Each month, host Suse Anderson investigates the work and personalities in and around the museum sector. I will leave these questions up for discussion: How do you feel about the digital world in the museum? Are we too dependent on technology or are we not taking enough advantage of it?

This shift is deemed crucial to uncover the credible projects that will pave the way for the global adoption of the innovative technology. Enterprises are actively working towards the adoption of new technologies for their existing business models however they face considerable challenges on the resources and the tedious process of digital transformation using blockchain and other technologies. Morpheus Labs is actively seeking partners that can accelerate and improve the wide range of services that they provide for enterprises seeking to adopt blockchain technology and Waves Platform is a natural choice due to their innovative approach, core competency technology and the common goal to simplify blockchain dApps development. The partnership involves working together to improve on all verticals, with the priority to integrate Waves core expertise and technology onto Morpheus Labs‚Äô Blockchain Platform-as-a-Service (BPaaS), and other areas such as public relations, branding, and marketing. Sasha Ivanov, CEO of Waves Platform, underlines that, ‚ÄúThe integration of Waves onto BPaaS will streamline the progress to gain access to Waves‚Äô technology into a convenient, user-friendly service, allowing students, developers and businesses to enhance and simplify dApp development without having to develop their own solutions from the ground up.‚Äù The partnership will be beneficial as it will expand the adoption of both Waves‚Äô and Morpheus Labs‚Äô services on a global scale, and pledge the commitment to enrich and build the community through various channels, as well as collaborate on business development and community-centric initiatives. Both parties will also look into organising of online/offline events such as AMAs, hackathons at the later part of the year. Chuang Pei-Han, CEO of Morpheus Labs, shared that, ‚ÄúIn this partnership, Morpheus Labs and Waves Platform will explore ways to enhance the technology to create a fuss-free and better user experience; adding value to enterprises around the world while gearing up for mass adoption. Integrating Waves‚Äô focus on dApp development with their wallet/payment features onto the Morpheus Labs platform not only creates value for our AppLibrary, but will also provide us with the opportunity to expand our presence within the European market.‚Äù Waves (https://wavesplatform.com) is an open source platform and decentralised environment for Web 3.0 applications, offering a wide range of purpose-designed tools for making the process of creating and running dApps easy and accessible. Launched in 2016 by Sasha Ivanov and a core development team, Waves has since released numerous successful blockchain-based solutions and has steadily developed into a rich and constantly-growing technological platform. Waves‚Äô technology is designed to address the needs of businesses and technology companies that want to leverage the properties of blockchain systems ‚Äî including their security, auditability, verifiability and the trustless execution of transactions and business logic. Waves Platform provides everything required to support the backend of Web 3.0 services. In 2017, Waves successfully launched its mainnet with LPoS, its decentralised exchange DEX and later the Waves-NG protocol. In 2018, the Waves development team delivered the first implementation of smart contracts. This was followed by the release of the RIDE programming language in 2019, a simple and powerful language for programming logic.

In the job market, they‚Äôve demanded, and increasingly obtained, the option to work remotely from home or a nearby coffee shop and enjoy more flexible hours. Rather than settling in the suburbs, many of them have chosen to live in city environments. Unlike previous generations, Millennials love living in urban centers. And when it comes to buying a home, this generation is also redefining what home-ownership and luxury mean to them ‚Äî and what they‚Äôre willing to pay for. Many Millennials chose to rent while they were in their twenties instead of investing in starter homes. Now in their thirties, they can afford higher-priced options. Because Millennials comprise a significant percentage of high-end home buyers, real estate agents need to be aware of the selling points that appeal to them ‚Äî and how to market to them effectively. Here are a few of the luxury home features Millennial homebuyers desire: Smaller Footprints. Millennials are forgoing larger houses with a lot of square footage in favor of smaller luxury homes that make smart use of space and are filled with high-end amenities and furnishings. Some of the most in-demand features include open concept living areas with plush living rooms and showcase kitchens, spa-like bathrooms, and multi-use rooms. Millennials desire functional layouts for entertaining and the flexibility to alter spaces to fit their needs, such as a yoga studio that can also be easily converted into a bedroom for overnight guests. Their preferred lifestyle and personal interests inform what they most want in a home. Smart Homes. Constant connectedness, both personally and professionally, has become the norm for Millennials. Fast internet access for telecommuters who work from home is a must. Another characteristic of Millennial daily life? Embracing the Internet of Things (IoT) to create a smart home filled with connected devices. This can include items like smart appliances, smart speakers, networked whole-house audio systems, smart thermostats to automatically adjust the temperature, voice-controlled lighting, and monitoring systems so homeowners can keep an eye on their dwelling whenever they‚Äôre away. If you‚Äôre selling a home with smart features, make sure potential buyers are aware of all its bells and whistles. If possible, have the homeowner set up a tablet with instructions so visiting guests can experience hands-on demonstrations. Green, Energy Efficient Homes. Millennials care about preserving the environment ‚Äî and simultaneously saving money doesn‚Äôt hurt, either. Energy-efficient and green homes are very desirable to this generation of homebuyers. These earth-friendly features can include items like solar power, indoor air purification systems, geothermal energy systems, and tankless water heaters. Because these types of apparatus are usually hidden behind walls or other barriers, they can be easy to overlook during a home tour. Highlight any green or energy-efficient assets in your marketing materials and be sure to do the same thing in the house itself. Print flyers or cards outlining green or energy-efficient features and position them where potential home buyers will see them, on a central table or even temporarily mounted on walls. Don‚Äôt forget to point out and educate prospective buyers on the tax benefits and ROI of these features. Location and Walkability. As Millennials flock to urban areas, walkability and proximity to public transportation are highly sought-after attributes. Many Millennials are interested in living in neighborhoods where they can mingle with like-minded individuals and have the option to stroll (often with their families or dogs) to local amenities. For longer treks, they may also prefer to commute via public transportation or use rideshare services. Some Millennials are eschewing car ownership completely in favor of using these modes of travel. Being able to navigate an area by foot or via public transportation is also desirable for out-of-town guests ‚Äî or renters. If a Millennial buyer is considering the possibility of renting out their home or listing it online to help finance their mortgage or generate extra income, walkability and convenient transportation options will help boost its popularity. Also, you may encounter urban-based Millennials who don‚Äôt want to buy a primary residence in the city; instead they‚Äôre choosing to rent there and purchase a vacation home elsewhere. No matter whether a luxury home is located in an urban center or a vacation hotspot, real estate agents should always be aware of the importance of walkability and easy access to transportation when it comes to Millennial buyers. Indoor/Outdoor Living Spaces for Wellness and Entertaining. Millennials want the option to stretch their living areas beyond the walls of their homes to include outdoor spaces. This is particularly true for those who live in cities, where green space is at a premium. Balconies, decks, or rooftop gardens are all excellent spots to take advantage of fresh air and offer additional places for entertaining, relaxing, and practicing mindfulness. High-end condo developers have started adding lush outdoor amenities meant to encourage wellness. There is no doubt that Millennials are having a profound effect on the world of luxury real estate. As they continue to purchase high-end homes, savvy real estate agents who take note of their unique buying behaviors and lifestyle preferences will be well-positioned to support them in their home buying endeavors. Agents who can become trusted collaborators will reap the benefits of assisting this increasingly affluent demographic, both now and in the future. -- -- www.leax.io Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*XlXsiQ2wrtKLx6dxq1EsgA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*XlXsiQ2wrtKLx6dxq1EsgA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*XlXsiQ2wrtKLx6dxq1EsgA.png"

Mainly, that intelligent life is wired to connect and communicate. Pat yourself on the back. Your unique existence on this Earth is the trickle down product of innumerable generations of behavioral engineering and social development. From early Sumerians evolving their primitive grunts into unique and complex languages to medieval societies inscribing their knowledge into tomes and stories, the progress of humanity can largely be interpreted as a social feat. Yet, it isn‚Äôt surprising to discover that other complex organisms, primarily but not limited to mammals, have also perpetuated generations of existence through the development of their own social mechanisms. From Dr. Alexander‚Äôs ‚ÄòRat Park‚Äô exploring how rats within social communities are better equipped to tackle opiate addictions to Cynthia Moss‚Äôs study of the elephant matriarch Echo and his parades‚Äô capacity for future planning and teamwork, the animal kingdom has by and large shown that it too has the capacity to develop unique evolutionary advantages through social development. All this speaks to the wider point about complex life gradually wiring itself to seek connection and communication, not just for the pleasure of conversation but in a more dire sense, for survival. This line of thinking enters a space known as evolutionary psychology or modern Darwinism. The discipline argues that although human beings today inhabit a thoroughly modern world filled with revolutionary innovations and technologies, they do so with the ingrained mentality of Stone Age hunter-gatherers. Recent DNA analyses have strongly suggested that the closest evidence to the modern human sprung from a small population (1,500 or so individuals) on the west coast of Africa about 60,000 years ago. Theoretically that group rapidly expanded to the Middle East and Far East, Europe and Southeast Asia, replacing or absorbing the Stone-Age Neanderthal populations of the time. Modern humans have proved to be sophisticated generalists, adapting through technology and culture to environments as varied as the Kalahari deserts, the Pacific Islands, and the icescapes of the north polar regions. In other words, these Homo sapiens that emerged on the African Savannah Plain thousands of years ago are seen to have developed and passed on traits that made their survival possible such as our instinct to fight furiously when threatened or our propensity to drive trade and share secrets. It‚Äôs important to note that I am not trying to overemphasize the nature over nurture side of evolutionary debate. As fellow Medium writer John Griswold reminded me, identifying ‚Äúhardwired‚Äù human behaviors is tricky and while there is extensive evidence about our prenatal ability to learn and use language for pair-bonding and community building, there are widespread cultural exceptions. Now consider your capacity for emotions like social anxiety and self-comparison, feelings that can often leave you hesitant and on edge. These emotional responses you experienced aren‚Äôt modern day flukes designed to make you feel bad but rather a hardwired Darwinian nudge to what your brain interprets as a ‚Äòred flag‚Äô environment. Remember that ill-feeling you got when you had to go to that party filled with people you didn‚Äôt know? That can basically be surmised as your inner caveman sensing a threat in the unknown. As the Harvard Business Review eloquently puts it ‚ÄúYou can take the person out of the Stone Age, but you can‚Äôt take the Stone Age out of the person‚Äù. Harvard professor and psychologist Steven Pinker once claimed ‚Äúthinking is computation but that does not mean the computer is a good metaphor for the mind‚Äù. Pinker‚Äôs assertion invites us to consider the extent to which our mind truly functions as a pre-programmed entity. I recommend readers interested in the ‚Äòsoftware‚Äô side of the debate do some further reading on the Dichotomized Operating System Model (DOS Model), a theory which attempts to demonstrate how the entire brain may function as one integrated system with the purpose to help us make decisions on an ongoing basis to reach our goals. For now, I‚Äôll summarize the main process the theory supposes. According to the DOS Model, the evolutionary process has divided our brain into two sections, each dealing with information in a particular way. One section is used for logical information processes and the other section for storage and retrieval of experiences. Dialogues within and between these two components are the birthplace of our verbal and non-verbal thoughts and communication. Such dialogues help us make decisions for our current and future experiences like that particular decision we discussed earlier about going to that party with people you don‚Äôt know. Through the dichotomy of these components, the model explains mechanisms and processes underlying fundamental mind phenomena under a single framework, making it a comprehensive albeit simplified account of the inner workings of the human mind. Consider how feelings of anxiety can vary from person to person, with some people experiencing it more than others. Using this theory as a thought framework, we can see one side acting as the particular processor or ‚Äòprogram‚Äô for anxiety, while the other side can be seen as the storage or ‚Äòinput‚Äô necessary for program to execute its original function. Most of us will experience forms of anxiety but the potency largely depends on our experiences or past traumas for which the processing side communicates with as its input. It‚Äôs the reason why depression and other social disorders have been historically misdiagnosed ‚Äî we failed to see the mind as a mechanism that can break rather than an irregularity we can quickly fix back into standard function. Although Pinker warns of using this comparison, comparing the brain to a computer is an increasingly tempting way to break down the mystery of the mind and its functionality. I can‚Äôt help but wonder how this will apply to the neural interfaces of the future. The simplicity of frameworks like the DOS model are important because they help us better understand the evolutionary logic that defines ourselves, our actions and our interpretation of the world around us. So far, we have discussed how the brain via natural selection has evolved both behaviorally and systematically to empower humans to fear, prevent and process threats in their surroundings. We also discussed earlier, how the brain of our hunter gatherer ancestors, through an immense amount of time, has wired itself to process information and experiences in a particular way for survival. However, it‚Äôs also important to be mindful that these reactions aren‚Äôt just limited to a handful but to a myriad of unique feelings and situations. By being more mindful about your thoughts, you can begin to identify why you feel a certain way. For instance, the reason we harbor negative feelings from social isolation can largely be interpreted as a defense mechanism our caveman ancestors developed at the early stages of human social development. Without the protection of the collective, separation from the tribe or village of the past most likely translated into imminent death by predation or starvation. Similarly, without our compulsive need to compare ourselves to one another, humans wouldn‚Äôt feel compelled to compete, work hard, and strive for the success of themselves and their families. It‚Äôs good psychology nowadays for one to avoid comparing herself to her peers yet with science we can interpret this inherent need to do so as another of the many survival mechanisms hardwired into our minds. These reactions might not always help us but its important to understand their inherent purpose through evolutionary design. Next time you feel anxious, take a step back and rationalize the emotion within the wider space it inhabits. Which are the conditions that can be interpreted as evolutionary threats? You might find this approach helpful in calming your nerves before your next big date or job interview. As the evidence in this blog post suggests, the brain we have today hasn‚Äôt changed much in the last 10,000 years. Moreover, up until the industrial revolution, human civilization trotted somewhat consistently down a developmental path. However, its difficult to dispute that in in just 200 years, humans have achieved more progress than ever previously imagined. Today, disease and predation have by and far been eliminated from the modern environment. Once small villages are now large bustling metropolises accompanied by a globalized transportation network that can traverse previously unsurpassable oceans and mountain ranges. Moreover, our ability to communicate with one another is no longer reserved to the physical realm with interconnected devices shuttling digital information to the heavens and back. We dream of multi-planetary space travel and strive for the ultimate wedding between mind and machine. Pat yourself again on the back, this time for your ancestors that paved the way through research, innovation and implementation. Large swathes of people no longer need to worry about the unknown because the unknown has largely been illuminated and conquered. You would think that with all this progress comes a utopic sense of emotional relief for our historically wired brain, yet the statistics tell an increasingly different story. People today are more anxious, lonely, and depressed than in any other generation. Previous generations fought global wars, deadly diseases, and the looming risk of famine. Today, the struggles of the modern world are largely defined as social issues and still we suffer. As we venture into the world of ever-more technological advancement, we must not forget the bindings of our past. I fear our brains will be geared for a race they are not prepared to compete in ‚Äî a techno-evolutionary treadmill that is simply too fast for the slow and naturally selective processes that have formed our brains thus far. As more abnormal, godlike technology descends upon us, we must ask ourselves how obsolete are we prepared to make the subconscious mind? Yet, this is a topic for another day.

The mind is a set of modules, but the modules are not encapsulated boxes or circumscribed swatches on the surface of the brain. The organization of our mental modules comes from our genetic program, but that does not mean that there is a gene for every trait or that learning is less important than we used to think. The mind is an adaptation designed by natural selection, but that does not mean that everything we think, feel, and do is biologically adaptive. We evolved from apes, but that does not mean we have the same minds as apes. And the ultimate goal of natural selection is to propagate genes, but that does not mean that the ultimate goal of people is to propagate genes.‚Äù‚Äï Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works -- -- 3 Get smarter at building your thing.

Lukukokemus her√§tti minussa ensin hitaasti nousevaa √§rsyynnyst√§; sitten arkaa naurua, nautintoakin. Ennen pitk√§√§ juiliva √§rtymys palasi eik√§ ottanut liikahtaakseen. Teoksen loppua l√§hestytt√§ess√§ tunnekirjo purkautui hiljalleen hiipuvaan surumielisyyteen. Laskettuani Tikkurilan kirjastosta aiemmin viikolla noutamani opuksen p√∂yd√§lle katsoin sit√§ pitk√§√§n. Kannen mustassa tilassa kelluu valkoinen ihmishahmo, kaavakuvamaisena, kasvottomana ja ilmeett√∂m√§n√§. Sis√§lt√§ figuuria kyll√§st√§v√§t kultakimalteiset voimaverkot ja sateenkaaris√§vyiset hermorihmat, ulkopuolelta sit√§ saartaa musta avaruus: tyylikk√§√§n minimalistinen, painostava tyhjyys vailla ilmaa, kasveja, el√§imi√§, maata. Alanurkassa kelluu rivi kullanhohtoisia symboleita: suihkukone, √∂ljytippa (vaiko kenties vett√§?), ty√∂kaluja, aurinkolasit, aurinko, ginimartini, tietokonekaiutin, t√§ysi akku, rahapussi ja viisisakarainen asteriski. N√§m√§ edustanevat kuvajaisen toimintamahdollisuuksia. Siin√§ leijuvat ikonit, joiden kautta kirjan hahmottelema luksus materialisoituu olennon el√§m√§√§n. Katselin hahmoa. Se pysytteli vaiti. Ilmeisest√§ vauraudestaan huolimatta se tuntui pyyt√§v√§n jotain. √Ñkki√§ tajusin, kuinka pieni otus kirja on. Huuto avaruuden √§√§rett√∂m√§ss√§ er√§maassa. Huomasin, ett√§ olin pettynyt. Tiedostamattani olin odottanut teokselta jotain, mit√§ se ei voinut tai halunnut tarjota: voimakasta, varteenotettavaa ja kokonaisvaltaista poliittista j√§sennyst√§. En ollut tajunnut, kuinka ohut, moniaalle hosuva ja ennen kaikkea eksyneen tuntuinen kokonaisuus kirja lopultakin minulle oli. Lukukokemustani s√§vytti ennen kaikkea levottomuuden, ahdistuneisuuden ja haurauden tuntu, josta oli vaikea sanoa kuuluiko se minulle vai itse tekstille. Haavoittuvuuden kokemus tuntui intiimilt√§ ja henkil√∂kohtaiselta ‚Äî mutta ei se tietenk√§√§n ole mit√§√§n yksityist√§. H√§mmennyksensekainen hauraus lienee t√§m√§nhetkisen l√§nsimaisen olemassaolon yleinen, vain ohuelti peitelty peruss√§vy. Kirjoitan siit√§ kenties joskus jotain. Mutta ensin hieman muuta. . . . . . . Avaruus ei ole kuva tulevaisuudesta, vaan menneisyydest√§. Nostalginen, 50-luvun technicolor-unelmista varastettu. Me emme ole matkalla sinne. Mit√§ pitemm√§lle 2000-luku etenee, sit√§ hankalammaksi viime vuosisadan tiedeuskovaisten haaveiden realisointi tuntuu k√§yv√§n. Viime aikojen SpaceX-hypetyksen varjoista on ruvennut kuulumaan kummia: aivan tiedeyhteis√∂n valtavirtaa l√§hell√§ olevat √§√§net ovat alkaneet huomautella, ettei avaruuden kolonisointi v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ ole mill√§√§n j√§rkev√§ll√§ mittapuulla tai aikataululla toteutettavissa. Samalla kun Elon Muskin henkinen (ja taloudellinen) sy√∂ksykierre syvenee syvenemist√§√§n kohti paranoidia psykoosia, nettimeemeist√§ tutuksi tullut amerikkalainen astrofyysikko Neil deGrasse Tyson on ykskantaan ilmoittanut, ett√§ Marsin kolonisointi on kerta kaikkiaan mahdotonta: l√§hinn√§ vaarallinen haaveuni. Marsin olosuhteet ovat Tysonin mukaan ihmisel√§m√§lle niin vihamieliset ja vieraat, ett√§ v√§h√§√§nk√§√§n suuremman hominidilauman toimittaminen planeetan kamaralle eloaan j√§rjest√§m√§√§n on etup√§√§ss√§ harhainen fantasia. K√§sityksess√§√§n Tyson ei ole yksin. Useat tieteelliset analyysit ‚Äî eiv√§t siis insin√∂√∂rien kaavakuvat saati start-up-yritt√§jien n√§yt ‚Äî alkavat hiljalleen konvergoitua tiettyyn suuntaan. Lyhyesti yhteenvedettyn√§: Ihmiset eiv√§t voi el√§√§ Marsissa. Ihmiset eiv√§t selvi√§ kovinkaan pitki√§ aikoja ulkoavaruudessa. Ihmiset eiv√§t voi laajassa mittakaavassa poistua aurinkokunnastamme ‚Äî etenk√§√§n asuttamaan toisia planeettoja. ‚Äì Jopa er√§s teknoakselerationismin arkkiatreista, scifikirjailija Kim Stanley Robinson on esitt√§nyt hyvin perustellun, uskottavan ja ennen kaikkea koviin luonnontieteisiin pohjaavan analyysin siit√§, miksi ihmisel√§m√§n siirtyminen aurinkokunnan ulkopuolelle on k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ mahdotonta. Robinson k√§y l√§pi avaruuskolonisaatioprojektin fysikaaliset, biologiset, ekologiset, sosiologiset ja psykologiset reunaehdot ja toteaa niiden kasaavan interstellaarisen projektin tielle nopeasti ylitsep√§√§sem√§tt√∂miksi √§ityvi√§ esteit√§. Ihmisen rahtaaminen pois telluksen pinnalta tarkoittaisi nimitt√§in viime k√§dess√§, ett√§ k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ koko planeetan biosf√§√§rin ja sen el√§m√§lle suotuisien olosuhteiden olisi seurattava mukana. Mik√§li siis hengiss√§ halutaan selvit√§. Ja moinen projekti on loppuviimeksi mahdoton. The tremendous increase in our knowledge of biology has taught us that human beings are much more complicated than we thought, being in effect complex assemblages interpenetrated with larger ecologies. These and other findings make a contemporary evaluation of the starfaring plan rather startling: one begins to see it can‚Äôt be done. Ihmisolento kun ei ole ymp√§rist√∂st√§√§n eristetty, minne hyv√§ns√§ rahdattavissa oleva postipaketti, vaan holobiontti ‚Äî huokoinen, l√§p√§isev√§ ja ep√§autonominen palanen laajempaa ekologista kontekstia. Inhimillinen el√§m√§ edellytt√§√§ jatkuvaa, vastavuoroista virtaamista elonkeh√§n kanssa. Ihmisen biofyysinen olemus ei kerta kaikkiaan sied√§ pitk√§aikaista kotomaailman ekosysteemeist√§ irtautumista. Jo viime vuosikymmenin√§ teollisissa yhteiskunnissa tapahtunut liev√§ erist√§ytyminen maaper√§n bakteeristosta l√§mmitettyjen kerrostalojen uumeniin on aiheuttanut laajamittaisen ja vakavan immuunisairausongelman: kun ruumiilla ei ole jatkuvaa yhteytt√§ immuunij√§rjestelmi√§ stimuloiviin bakteerikantoihin, alkavat kehon defenssij√§rjestelm√§t k√§√§nty√§ itse√§√§n vastaan. (P√§√§asiassa t√§st√§ johtuvat vaikkapa Suomen allergia- ja astmaepidemiat.) Ja mit√§ erist√§ytyneempi ymp√§rist√∂, sit√§ hurjempia pulmia on luvassa. Avaruudessa ne mit√§ luultavimmin riist√§ytyisiv√§t k√§sist√§. Kaikessa yksinkertaisuudessaan t√§m√§ tarkoittaa, ett√§ olemassaolomme repiminen irti ekologisesta ja evolutiivisesta kontekstistaan ei ole kovinkaan yksinkertaista. Itse asiassa se on tuskin mitenk√§√§n mahdollista. My√∂s yksil√∂tasolla ja lyhyemmill√§ aikaj√§nteill√§ avaruus on etup√§√§ss√§ ja ennen kaikkea vaarallinen, el√§m√§lle vihamielinen ymp√§rist√∂. V√§h√§√§k√§√§n pitempi oleskelu painottomissa tiloissa aiheuttaa radikaalia lihasatropiaa ja luukatoa. Kansainv√§lisell√§ avaruusasemalla vain muutaman kuukaudenkin viett√§neill√§ astronauteilla on eritt√§in suuri vaikeuksia sopeutua maan painovoimakentt√§√§n; tukiranka ja lihakset eiv√§t ota palautuakseen. Pitempiaikainen nollapainovoimalle altistuminen aiheuttaisi todenn√§k√∂isesti syd√§nlihaksen seisahtumisen tai kehon tukirangan surkastumisen olemattomiin. Ihmiskunnan maapallon syleilyst√§ vapautuminen tarkoittaisi puolestaan, ett√§ ep√§inhimillisten olosuhteiden kanssa eiv√§t kamppailisi vain yksitt√§iset ihmiset, vaan kokonaiset sukupolvet imev√§isineen, vanhuksineen; sairaineen ja synnytyksineen. Kaikki t√§m√§ viittaa yhteen suuntaan: ihmislajin biologian ja ekologian adaptatiivisuudelle on olemassa k√§yt√§nn√∂llisesti katsoen ylitsep√§√§sem√§tt√∂mi√§ rajoja. Avaruuteen siirtyminen on er√§s niist√§. ‚Äì Ja mik√§li nuo rajat olisivatkin tilap√§isesti ylitett√§viss√§, el√§m√§ niiden tuolla puolen (kuten radioaktiivisen s√§teilyn pommittamassa, hermeettisesti suljetussa ja ankarasti hallinnoidussa Mars-koloniassa) olisi todenn√§k√∂isesti etup√§√§ss√§ hobbesilaista: nasty, brutish and short. Toisin kuin meit√§ opetetaan tolkuttamaan itsellemme, kaikki ei olekaan mahdollista. Avaruus ‚Äî ja k√§sitteen sis√§√§n voi laskea Marsin, kiertoradalla el√§misen ja kaikki mahdolliset eksoplaneetat ‚Äî on mit√§ suurimmalla todenn√§k√∂isyydell√§ periaattellisesti katsottuna ihmisel√§m√§lle saavuttamaton horisontti. Ilman telluksen m√§√§r√§tynlaisia, hyvin kapealle sektorille asettuvia ymp√§rist√∂olosuhteita ihmisorganismi ei kerta kaikkiaan selvi√§. (Eik√§ itse asiassa mik√§√§n muukaan toistaiseksi tunnettu, v√§h√§√§k√§√§n kompleksisempi organismi.) Maapallo on meid√§n ainut kotimme. . . . . . . Filosofi Ed Regisin mukaan ajatus t√§htienv√§lisest√§ siirtokuntailusta onkin ennen kaikkea esimerkki patologisesta teknologiasta: teknologiasta, jonka reaaliset riskit ja kustannukset ylitt√§v√§t reippaasti kaikki siit√§ mahdollisesti saatavat hy√∂dyt ‚Äî mutta joka silti kantaa ymp√§rill√§√§n selitt√§m√§t√∂nt√§ innostuksen auraa. Regisin nimitys patologista teknologiaa ymp√§r√∂iv√§n p√∂hin√§n ja hypetyksen auralle on osuva: ‚Äúthe Delirium‚Äù. Harhan huumassa patologiseen teknologiaan ‚Äî kuten esimerkiksi maailmansotia edelt√§neeseen saksalaiseen zeppeliiniteknologiaan ‚Äî syydet√§√§n varoja, ty√∂t√§ sek√§ aikaa riskej√§ kaihtamatta, tolkusta riippumatta. Patologisen teknologian s√§teilem√§ h√§ik√§isev√§ symboliarvo sulkee silm√§t kaikenlaisen kohtuuden ja j√§rkevyyden varoituksilta. T√§ss√§ ei sokaistuta ei niink√§√§n ratiolta, laskelmoivalta j√§rjelt√§, vaan k√§yt√§nn√∂n j√§rkevyydelt√§, sofrosynelt√§, jonka pit√§isi kertoa, mink√§ pyrinn√∂n toteuttaminen on inhimillisesti tai yhteis√∂llisesti ylimalkaan mielek√§st√§. Patologisen teknologian pauloissa puntaroiva j√§rki k√§√§ntyy irvikuvakseen. Tere Vad√©n l√§hestyy viimeaikaisessa kolumnissaan samaa ilmi√∂t√§ fossiilihybriksen nimell√§. Mielenkiintoisella tavalla s√§√§ntelem√§tt√∂m√§n hybriksen huippu n√§ytt√§√§ vastaavan t√§sm√§lleen luonnontiedevetoisen teknologian huippua. Unelmat muutosta Marsiin tai maapallon ilmastomuokkaus (geoengineering) ovat yht√§√§lt√§ luonnontiedeteknologian kaikkein j√§rkevin ja kaunein lupaus, toisaalta hybrisen teiniuhon lapsellisin ilmaus. Mik√§√§n muu kuin hybrinen huumaantuminen ei selit√§ t√§llaista j√§rjen ja sokeuden sekamuotoa. Sit√§ paitsi: yhden ainoan ihmisruumiin sinkoaminen kiertoradalle, siis vain noin 400 kilometrin p√§√§h√§n maan pinnasta vaatii enemm√§n ty√∂t√§, resursseja, energiaa ja vaivaa kuin keskikokoisen yliopistokampuksen rakentaminen. Ihmiskunnan pakoa el√§m√§mme kehdosta jonkin aikaa ennen kuolemaansa advokoinut Stephen Hawkingkin tunnusti, ett√§ maapallolta poistuminen olisi vain ‚Äúmuutaman tuhannen ihmisen‚Äù asia. Mist√§√§n demokraattisesta prosessista lienee t√§ss√§ yhteydess√§ siis turha puhuakaan. Oli miten oli, minulle on ainakin piirtynyt selv√§ksi yksi asia: min√§ ‚Äî eik√§ kukaan minun koskaan tuntemani ihminen ‚Äî tule koskaan nousemaan t√§htitarhoihin. . . . . . . Ei voi olla totta! Niinp√§ niin. Tajunnan per√§kammareissa p√§√§osin tiedostamatta py√∂riv√§n avaruusoopperakuvaston kyseenalaistuminen aiheuttaa nykyihmisess√§ l√§hinn√§ ep√§uskoa ja h√§mmennyst√§, tyrmistyksensekaisista kieltoreaktioista puhumattakaan. Minunkin oli aikanaan vaikea sovittautua oivallukseen interstellaarisen el√§m√§n perinpohjaisesta saavuttamattomuudesta ‚Äî olenhan itsekin kasvanut aikuiseksi Star Trekin ja -Warsin, avaruusmatkailua rutiininomaisena retkeilyharrasteena kuvaavien kirjojen, pelien ja sarjakuvien ymp√§r√∂im√§n√§. Olen uneksinut dilithium-kristalleista, fuusiomoottoreista ja takyonisuojuksista. Mutta jonakin p√§iv√§n√§, eik√§ niin kauaakaan sitten, se viimein valkeni: eiv√§th√§n galaksikuvastot oikeastaan ole muuta kuin kuvia n√§ytt√∂p√§√§tteill√§ ja kirjoitusmerkkej√§ paperilla. M√§√§r√§tynlaisen historiallisen yhteiskuntamuodon symbolista eritteist√∂√§. Tulevaisuus, sellaisena kuin se nyt omalla vuosituhannellamme tuntuu ekologisten ja teknologisten kehityskulkujen my√∂t√§ realisoituvan, tulee olemaan tyystin muuta. Uskoa teknologisen ‚Äúedistyksen‚Äù ennen pitk√§√§ mukanaan tuomaan kosmiseen ekspansioon on kuitenkin sangen vaikea ravistaa nykyl√§nkk√§rist√§ ulos. John Michael Greeria mukaillen, vaste on sama kuin jos ‚Äúyritt√§isi kertoa keskiaikaiselle talonpojalle ettei taivasta Jumalineen, kaikkine pyhimyksineen ja enkeleineen olekaan olemassa‚Äù Nyt ei nimitt√§in puhuta tiedosta, hyvin perustellusta uskomuksesta, ei oikeastaan mink√§√§nlaiseen empiriaan pohjaavasta otaksumasta: avaruusmielikuva on uskonnollinen, myyttinen kuva. Enemm√§n kuin mist√§√§n muusta se kertoo l√§peens√§ fossilisoidun, energiahuumaantuneen kulttuurimme mytologisten syv√§vakaumusten luonteesta. Voisi per√§ti v√§itt√§√§, ett√§ avaruus on oman kapitalismilla h√∂ystetyn teknologia- ja edistysuskontomme viimek√§tinen eskatologinen horisontti: onhan sekulaariksi insin√∂√∂ripulmaksi maskeerattu uskonkysymys t√§htitarhoihin raketoitumisesta onnistunut viimeisen vuosisadan mittaan ainakin osaltaan syrj√§ytt√§m√§√§n teologiset kysymykset taivaasta, lunastuksesta ja viimeisest√§ tuomiosta. 1900-luvun ajan rautaesiripun molemmin puolin viljellyt n√§kym√§t avaruussukkuloista ja kansoitetuista t√§htitarhoista ovat tulkittavissa osiksi L√§nnen laajaa, pitk√§ik√§ist√§ siirtym√§√§ kristinuskon m√§√§ritt√§m√§st√§ teosentrisest√§ maailmankuvasta kohti tieteen, valistuksen ja edistyksen nimiin vannovaa modernia antroposentrista konstellaatiota. Edistyksen myytti ja siihen tiiviisti kytkeytyv√§ ajatus kumuloituvasta teknologisesta ‚Äúkehityksest√§‚Äù kantaa v√§ist√§m√§tt√§ mukanaan omaa pelastushorisonttiaan. Nykymuodossaan avaruusfantasiointi on l√§hinn√§ 1800-luvun mittaan tuottunut uskonnollisluonteinen psykorakenne, jonka synty√§ on ennen kaikkea ollut edesauttamassa fossiilisten polttoaineiden suoma energiapurskaus ‚Äî yhdistettyn√§ eurooppalaisten monoteististen valtauskontojen ruumis- ja maailmapakoiseen metafysiikkaan. Fossiilisen modernin perusvakaumuksena kun on sama vanha judeokristillisen transsendessin virsi: totuus ja el√§m√§ ovat toisaalla, horisontin takana, maa-ilman tomumajojen ja sotkuisten, syntisten el√§mien tuolla puolen. Utopiassa. Ei-paikassa. T√§m√§ tuo meid√§t sen kysymyksen √§√§relle, kuinka sekulaari l√§nsimainen yhteiskuntamuoto oikeastaan onkaan. Mutta se veisi jo sivuun itse asiasta. . . . . . . T√§ss√§ kohdin lukijalle lieneekin tullut selv√§ksi, mik√§ TAAHLK:ta lukiessani minua niin kovasti hiersi. Kokemani √§rsytys ja raivo syntyi etup√§√§ss√§ juuri modernismin masentavimman ja kirjaimellisesti tyhjimm√§n lupauksen ‚Äî avaruuden ‚Äî ottamisesta ilmeisen tosissaan. Teoksen omituinen, l√∂ys√§ heittely ‚Äúuusista planeetoista‚Äù, ‚Äúavaruuteen karkaamisesta‚Äù ja niin edelleen tuntui paitsi ep√§kyps√§lt√§, my√∂s vastenmielisen piittaamattomalta suhteessa kotoisen ekologisen katastrofimme vakavuuteen. Sivilisaatiomme ja biosf√§√§rimme perustat ovat murenemassa. Viitsiik√∂ joku tosiaan viel√§ el√§tell√§ noinkin intomielisi√§ k√§sityksi√§ fututeknologian siunaavista potentiaaleista? Soitella kuolevan fossiilikapitalismin ep√§vireisi√§ urkuja, yh√§ edelleen? Uneksia itsetuhoaan kohti rymisev√§n teknoj√§rjestelm√§n omia unia? ‚Äî Etenkin kun tarkoitus olisi kaiketi tarjota ohjenuoria mahdolliselle vastarinnalle. Tekisi mieli huutaa: luojan t√§hden! Ei avaruushaaveilu voi mill√§√§n viitoittaa tiet√§ ulos fossiilisen el√§m√§nmuodon umpikujista! Seh√§n on itsess√§√§n niiden keskeinen rakennuspalikka! Erityisen vaaralliselta minusta tuntuivat akselerationististen, jopa millenaristisiksi √§ityvien sanank√§√§nteiden k√§ytt√§minen. ‚ÄúYhden planeetan elinpiirist√§ vapautuminen‚Äù ei totisesti tunnu innostavalta tulevaisuudenvisiolta; mieleen tuli l√§hinn√§ patologinen, el√§m√§npakoinen harha. Sanamuotohan suorastaan halveksuu elonkeh√§√§, Gaian lajirikkautta ja monimuotoisuutta ‚Äî niit√§ el√§m√§n edellytyksi√§, jotka maapallon ohuella ja hauraalla kuorella lienev√§t galaktisestikin uniikkeja. Ik√§√§n kuin maan, ilman, veden, kasvien ja el√§inten ymp√§r√∂im√§n√§ el√§minen olisi jotenkin rajoittavaa! Ik√§√§n kuin ainoasta tuntemastamme elinkelpoisesta ymp√§rist√∂st√§ pit√§isi jotenkin p√§√§st√§ vapautumaan! Psykoanalyyttisesti tulkittuna fraasin voisi ymm√§rt√§√§ kieliv√§n jonkinlaisesta kulttuurin syv√§rakenteeseen jumittuneesta √§itiruumiin pelosta, pime√§√§n maaper√§√§n tukahtumisen kauhusta. Mutta t√§llainen l√§hestymistapa ei liene muodikas. Kirjan √§lyk√§s ja hauskakin kirjallisuusessee modernin kiihtyv√§st√§ juuriltaanmenosta ja eksistentiaalisesta disorientaatiosta (‚ÄúTornadon keskell√§‚Äù) p√§√§ttyy puolestaan kuvaan, jossa ‚Äúkaasutetaan avaruusraketilla tornadon l√§pi toiselle puolelle‚Äù. Kohdan lukiessani tunsin l√§hinn√§ tuskansekaista h√§mmennyst√§. Utopistinen metaforiikka yltyy jo esoteerisiin korkeuksiin. Retorinen ratkaisu elinolosuhteita ja el√§m√§nmuotoja hajalleen repiv√§√§n tuhoj√§rjestelm√§√§n l√∂ytyy transsendenssin lupauksesta, komposiittisymbolista, jossa avaruuden mustaa taustaa vasten sulautuvat yhteen ikuinen toisto (py√∂rre) ja suora ‚Äúpaon viiva‚Äù (avaruusraketti). Alkemistinen yin-yang, hieros gamos: kaaos ja edistys, spiraali ja suora yhdess√§. Symboli syntyy aina tarpeeseen. T√§ss√§ tarve on ilmeinen: pakenemisajatuksen my√∂t√§ postmodernin siet√§m√§t√∂n ahdistus laantuu. Ulosp√§√§sy on olemassa. Tottahan faustinen raketilla kaasuttelija vie viimeisen voiton: aina on l√∂ydett√§viss√§ jokin singulaariseen pakonopeuteen pohjautuva toispuoleinen ratkaisu. Kohti √§√§rett√∂myytt√§ ‚Äî ja sen yli! ‚Äì julistaa j√§yh√§leukainen, muovinen leluastronautti Buzz Lightyear Disneyn tietokoneanimoidussa seikkailutarinassa. . . . . . . Mutta mutta! ‚Äî T√§ss√§ kohdin alkaa sis√§inen itsekriitikkoni her√§ill√§. Enk√∂h√§n ole nyt teosta kohtaan hieman ep√§reilu? Eih√§n Avaruus ole suinkaan opuksen vaatimuksista tai v√§itt√§mist√§ mill√§√§n muotoa keskeisin. Pikemminkin kyseess√§ on jonkinlainen itseironinen, pop-s√§vytteinen scifimetafora, jonka tarkoitus on l√§hinn√§ avata poliittisen kuvittelun mahdollisuuksia, masinoida halua. Ei kai TAAHLK:n tarkoituksena ole suinkaan singota ihmiskuntaa kaikkinensa kiertoradalle, vaan valaa utooppista uskoa yhdess√§ tekemisen kommunitaarisiin potentiaaleihin? ‚Äî Avaruus on mukana enemm√§nkin symboliarvon t√§hden. Sit√§ paitsi: eiv√§tk√∂ kirjan ansiot ole voittopuolisesti toisaalla? Eik√∂ se sis√§ll√§ taitavia, √§lyllisesti stimuloivia kirjallisuus- ja pop-kulttuurianalyyseja? Eik√∂ se tarkastele k√∂yhyyden ja n√§k√∂alattomuuden kokemusta samaistuttavalla, koskettavalla ja voimaannuttavallakin tavalla? Eik√∂ se k√§√§nn√§ ansiokkaasti katsetta yhteis√∂jen kollektiivisesti tuottamiin el√§misen edellytyksiin? Eiv√§tk√∂ sen poliittiset vaatimukset ‚Äî vaikkapa perustulosta ja vapaa-ajan lis√§√§misest√§ ‚Äî ole kaikin puolin kannatettavia? Toki, toki, toki. Kukapa olisin t√§t√§ kaikkea vastustamaan. Kirjan lukeminen her√§tti minussa tosiaan hersyv√§n mielihyv√§n tunteita, my√∂s kaiken kokemani hankaluuden l√§vitse. Teoksen √§lylliset ansiot lienev√§t kiist√§m√§tt√∂m√§t. Mutta silti, jokin j√§√§ hiert√§m√§√§n. Jostain syyst√§ Avaruuden kuva ei j√§t√§ minua rauhaan. Se voi vaikuttaa teoksen ajatuskudelmassa n√§enn√§isesti perifeeriselt√§ seikalta; omassa lukukokemuksessani se saattaa kuitenkin koko TAAHLK:n projektin omalaatuiseen valoon. En mill√§√§n p√§√§se siit√§ irti. Siksi t√§m√§ essee ‚Äì jonka voi toki ymm√§rt√§√§ etup√§√§ss√§ jonkin oman p√§√§h√§npinttym√§ni ilmaukseksi. Yht√§ kaikki, Sosiologi Veikko Eranti tuntuu osuvan omassa kiitt√§v√§ss√§ kommenttipuheenvuorossaan oikeaan todetessaan, ett√§ Avaruus on TAAHLK:n aktivoimista visioista suurin ja ‚Äút√§rkein‚Äù. Se on edistyst√§, lopullista luksusta, tulevaisuutta ‚Äî suuria kollektiivisia projekteja, v√§ltt√§m√§tt√∂m√§st√§ kielt√§ytymist√§, itsetarkoituksellisen vaikeaan ryhtymist√§. T√§sm√§lleen niin. Ja juuri t√§m√§ jatkuvan edistyksen, n√∂rttimaskuliinisen ‚Äúitsetarkoituksellisen vaikeaan ryhtymisen‚Äù hehkutus h√§iritsee minua. Massiivisen mobilisaation vaatiminen ‚Äî teollisen modernin prometeaanisten mahtien symbolinen uudelleenaktivointi ‚Äî vaikuttaa jonkinlaiselta oireelta. Ik√§√§n kuin se antaisi vihi√§ jostain, johon TAAHLK itsepintaisesti v√§ltt√§√§ katsomasta. Sen utooppinen ajattelu kielt√§ytyy ottamasta omia seuraamuksiaan vakavasti. Jostakinhan silm√§mme k√§√§ntyv√§t pois, kun nostamme katseemme t√§htitaivaalle. . . . . . . (Sivuun: en voi sille mit√§√§n, ett√§ ilmaisu ‚Äúlopullinen luksus‚Äù kalahtaa korvaani pahaenteisesti. Kuin kiinni paiskautuva sellin ovi. Tai sinkkiarkun kansi. Menisin mieluummin vaikka l√§himets√§√§n m√§t√§nem√§√§n kuin suostuisin sinet√∂it√§v√§ksi ‚Äúlopulliseen luksukseen‚Äú. ‚Äì Ja mit√§ vikaa olisi pieniss√§ kollektiivisissa projekteissa, pyramidien rakentelun sijaan?) . . . . . No, mit√§ TAAHLK sitten v√§istelee? Ensimm√§inen tarjokas l√∂ytyy nopeasti; probleeman on muotoillut takku.netin keskustelupalstan kommentoija nimimerkill√§ ‚Äújaahas‚Äù: Kertokaa jos t√§ss√§ on jotain uutta, mutta t√§√§ teko√§ly/luksus/robotiikka uuh..aah.. tuntuu olevan aika irrallaan tuotantoteknisest√§ todellisuudesta ja ylip√§√§t√§√§n siit√§ mit√§ t√§ysautomatisoitu el√§m√§ on ja onko se edes mill√§√§n tavalla tavoittelemisen arvoista? Onko siin√§ merkityst√§? Edelleen kysymys on siit√§ mist√§ tulee koko ketjun raaka-aineet ja mihin ne k√§yt√∂n j√§lkeen h√§vi√§√§. (Olen mieluusti v√§√§r√§ss√§, mutta t√§ss√§ vaan haiskahtaa v√§h√§n sellainen p√§√§kaupunkikeskeinen omia pieruja haisteleva elitismi, jossa ollaan hip ja cool, mutta vakavasti otettavan yhteiskuntapohdinnan suhteen on v√§h√§n niin ja n√§in.) Toden totta. Ekologisten kriisien k√§rjistymisen aikakaudella kysymys siit√§, ‚Äúmist√§ tulee koko ketjun raaka-aineet ja mihin ne k√§yt√∂n j√§lkeen h√§vi√§√§‚Äù ei ole mielenkiintoinen lis√§pohdiskelun aihe poliittis-utooppisen tykittelyn lomassa, vaan itse asiassa se kaikkein t√§rkein kysymys, se jonka varassa jokainen yhteiskuntafilosofia joko seisoo tai kaatuu, oli kyseess√§ utopia tai ei. Perustason Slush-teknofiilistelij√§lle energiaperustan ja luonnonvarojen rajallisuuden pulmaon tietty l√§hinn√§ kiusallinen sontak√§rp√§nen, joka k√§y korvaan surisemaan juuri kun visiointi on p√§√§sem√§ss√§ kunnolla vauhtiin. Niinp√§ se l√§nt√§t√§√§n mieluiten alaviitteeseen ja k√§sitell√§√§n sivukysymyksen√§ jotta sen laajemmat implikaatiot eiv√§t p√§√§sisi levi√§m√§√§n itse teknovuodatukseen. Ulkoisvaikutusten on pysytt√§v√§ ulkoisvaikutuksina. √Ñl√§ sotke ympyr√∂it√§ni! TAAHLK:n ansioksi on luettava, ett√§ se sent√§√§n yritt√§√§ ottaa pulman vakavasti. (Kiitos my√∂s siit√§, ett√§ omiin, joskus esitt√§miini vastalauseisiin my√∂s edes koetetaan l√∂yt√§√§ jonkinlaisia vastineita.) Kirja suomii (ohimennen) V√§h√§m√§en ja Vir√©nin Seutu joka ei ole paikkaa ilmastonmuutoksen unohtamisesta sek√§ energiavirtojen poispainamisesta, Salmisen ja Vad√©nin Energiaa ja kokemusta kotvan verran referoiden. V√§hemm√§n yll√§tt√§v√§√§ onkin sitten, ett√§ ekologinen ja materialistinen kritiikki solahtaa TAAHLK:sta kuin vesi √∂ljytahraisen joutsenen sel√§st√§. Sen varsinaiseen yhteiskunta-ajatteluun ei katastrofaalisten ulkoisvaikutusten ja resurssirajojen kysymyksest√§ j√§√§ mit√§√§n sen syvempi√§ vaikutuksia. K√§y kuten yleens√§kin ymp√§rist√∂n√§k√∂kulman kanssa: asia mainitaan vain jotta se voitaisiin unohtaa. Edes ilmastonmuutos ‚Äî tuo ymp√§rist√∂katastrofeista yll√§tt√§v√§√§ kyll√§ salonkikelpoisin ‚Äî ei ole TAAHLK:lle sen enemp√§√§ kuin Seutu joka ei ole paikalle tosiaankaan ilmi√∂, joka Naomi Kleinin jalanj√§ljiss√§ ‚Äúmuuttaisi kaiken‚Äù. Etenk√§√§n panisi arvioimaan teknologia- ja luontosuhdetta radikaalisti uusiksi. TAAHLK ei esimerkiksi tunnu osaavan tehd√§ selke√§√§ eroa luonnonvarojen absoluuttisen rajallisuuden ‚Äî jota mielell√§ni nimitt√§isin arkkiniukkuudeksi ‚Äî ja niiden yhteiskunnallisesta distribuutiosta aiheutuvan niukkuuden v√§lill√§. Kirjassa luonnonvaroja tunnustetaan paikoin olevan rajalliset m√§√§r√§t, toisaalta todetaan ett√§ juuri ja eritoten ‚Äúkapitalismi tuottaa niukkuutta‚Äù. Teos huojahtelee ep√§varmasti esimerkiksi √∂ljyvarojen kertaluontoisuuden ja energian ‚Äúperiaatteellisesti‚Äù mitattoman runsauden v√§lill√§. Lopulta se tuntuu asettuvan kannalle, jossa kapitalismi ja ‚Äúeliitit‚Äù ovat ainoita varsinaisia syyp√§it√§ mihink√§√§n niukkuuteen, ja n√§in ollen ainoita joiden kulutustaso varsinaisesti muodostaa mink√§√§nn√§k√∂isen ekologisen ongelman; ‚Äúalunperin‚Äù ja periaatteessa kaikkea on kaikille, rajattomasti. Jollain tapaa kommunismi sitten ratkaisee kaiken. Kaiketi t√§st√§ syyst√§ teoksen on aika ajoin maalailtava horisonttiin erin√§k√∂isi√§ insin√∂√∂rij√§rjen libidinaalilatautuneita haavekuvia: tulevia fuusioreaktoreita ja rajatonta energiaa tahkoavia massiivisia aurinkopurjeita. Teollisen sivilisaation synnytt√§nyt fossiilinen energiapurske kun ei voi olla luonnonhistoriallisesti ainutkertainen tapahtuma. Se ei saa olla! Jossain horisontin takana, aivan k√§den ulottuvilla on oltava eksergiaj√§rjestelm√§n viisasten kivi, ehtym√§t√∂n ja saasteeton vaurauden l√§hde, joka ratkaisee antroposentrisen ekspansion kiusalliset rajallisuuspulmat. T√§t√§ my√∂ten piirtyy esiin er√§s niist√§ symbolisista funktioista, joita Avaruus tekstiss√§ toimittaa: pohjimmiltaan se on rajattomuuden kuva. Avaruushaaveen t√§rkeimpi√§ funktioita fossiilisessa mielikuvituksessa kun on juuri √§√§rett√∂myyden, pohjattomuuden ja ehtym√§tt√∂myyden fantasman yll√§pit√§minen. L√§nsimaisessa ‚Äî spengleril√§isitt√§in faustisessa ‚Äî konseptiossa avaruus jatkuu aina tilana √§√§rett√∂miin: sielt√§h√§n voi l√∂yty√§ mit√§ hyv√§ns√§! Mik√§ hyv√§ns√§ on edelleen mahdollista! Eritoten meille! Avaruus onkin ollut l√§nsimaisessa mielikuvituksessa aina juuri t√§t√§: final frontier, Star Treki√§ lainatakseni. Viimeinen tyhj√§ korpimaa, jonne ty√∂nty√§, kun olo omissa ympyr√∂iss√§ alkaa k√§yd√§ liian ahtaaksi; viimeinen rajaseutu, jota l√§hte√§ louhimaan, kun omat varannot ovat vaarassa ehty√§. N√§in saavutaan teknoutopismin ‚Äî ja samantien monen muunkinlaisen utopismin ‚Äî kovaan ytimeen: sen haluttomuuteen tunnustaa rajallisuutta. Kyvytt√∂myyteen luopua loputtomiin laajenevan sivilisaatioprojektin myyttisest√§ ideasta. TAAHLK k√§rsiikin juuri siit√§ fossiilisen modernin perussyndroomasta, jota Antti Salminen ja Tere Vad√©n nimitt√§v√§t ‚Äúeksergiaunelmaksi‚Äù: rajattoman ekspansion fantasmasta. Siksi TAAHLK piirustelee olemattomia fuusioreaktoreita. Toimiakseen t√§m√§nkaltainen ekspansiivinen utopia tarvitsee jonkin poliittisesti korrektin Sammon; muutenhan teknosivilisaation unelmien unelmointi tekisi ten√§n heti alkuunsa. Avaruus onkin etup√§√§ss√§ symbolinen osa t√§t√§ ehtym√§tt√∂mien varantojen, rajattomuuden fantasian psykososiaalista konstellaatiota. Ja se on puolestaan niin l√§nsimainen kuin olla ja osaa. . . . . . . Otaksun t√§m√§n k√§sityksen l√§nsiekspansion periaatteellisesta rajattomuudesta johtuvan osaltaan deleuzelaisesti luetun marxilaisuuden vaikutuksesta. Deleuze ja Guattarihan v√§itt√§v√§t tunnetusti, ett√§ ‚Äúkapitalismilla ei ole ulkoista rajaa‚Äù, tai ett√§ ‚Äúkapitalismin viimeinen raja on kapitalismi itse‚Äù. Huomattavasti v√§hemm√§n mediaseksik√§s ‚Äì joskin vastaavasti monella tapaa n√∂yrempi ‚Äì teesi olisi todeta, ett√§ niin kapitalismilla kuin mill√§ tahansa muullakin yhteiskuntaj√§rjestelm√§ll√§ on kuin onkin rajoja: ekologisia, energeettisi√§. Yhteiskuntaformaationa, vaikka sitten kuinka hyperinnovatiivisena ja deterritorialisoivana, kapitalismi ei kykene liudentamaan kaikkia laajenemisensa tiell√§ olevia esteit√§. Kapitalismi on tietyn telluksen pinnalla operoivan homidilajin kollektivisen organisaation muoto; elonkeh√§n puitteissa toimiva energian ja materian virtauksiin perustuva j√§rjestelm√§. Se el√§√§ tietynmuotoisesta energianl√§hteest√§, tietynkokoisessa ekologisessa lokerossa ja tietynpaksuisessa energeettisess√§ laskoksessa. Johonkin rajoihin se seisahtuu. Ennen pitk√§√§. Mink√§ t√§hden noiden rajojen ylitt√§misest√§ tulisi ekokriisin aikakaudella edelleen haaveilla? Eik√∂ voitaisi antaa n√§iden haaveiden viimein raueta; k√§√§nt√§√§ katse el√§m√§n edellytysten hoivaamiseen; sis√§√§n-, taakse- ja alasp√§in? Ajatella luontosuhde uudelleen, t√§ll√§ kertaa kunnolla? . . . . . . . (Rajallisuus, mahdottomuus ja √§√§rellisyys ovat tunnetusti l√§nsimaiselle subjektiviteetille hankalia sulatettavia. Niihin t√∂rm√§√§minen on suorastaan traumaattinen kokemus. 1900-luvun tieteen historia ‚Äî G√∂delin teoreemineen ja kvanttimekaanisine ep√§tarkkuusperiaatteineen ‚Äî on t√§st√§ hyv√§ esimerkki. Rajallisuuden tajun asteittaisen palautumisen ei kuitenkaan tarvitse tarkoittaa mielekkyyden h√§vi√§mist√§; ei ainakaan mik√§li loputtoman ekspansion fantasmasta voidaan luopua. P√§invastoin, tarpeettoman edistyksen unelmasta her√§√§minen voi merkityksellist√§√§ todellisuuden yll√§tt√§v√§ll√§ tavalla uudestaan. Rajallisuudesta, mahdottomuudesta ja tieteest√§ ks. John D. Barrow: Impossibility: The Limits of Science and the Science of Limits.) . . . . . . TAAHLK:n ideologisessa v√§ist√∂liikkeess√§ ei toki sin√§ns√§ ole mit√§√§n ihmeellist√§. Ekologiset rajat ovat ‚Äî ja ovat aina olleet ‚Äî l√§nsimaisessa yhteiskunta-ajattelussa marginaalin marginaalissa. Materiaalien ja energian virrat ovat yh√§ edelleen poliksen pime√§ k√§√§nt√∂puoli, alavatsa jonne ei turhan pitk√§√§n haluta tuijotella: fiilikset kun voivat menn√§ piloille. Luonnon monimuotoisuus ja yhteiskuntael√§m√§n ehdoton riippuvaisuus siit√§ ovat sitten jo aivan liian hankalia asioita tietoisuuteen nostettavaksi. Materiaalisten tuotantovirtojen ja niiden ekologisten kytk√∂sten hienovarainen sivuuttaminen ‚Äî yhteyksien solmimatta j√§tt√§minen ‚Äî on tietenkin poliittisesti k√§tev√§√§: sen avulla luksuskommunisti voi toisella k√§dell√§ vaatia vaikkapa valtavia alueita luonnonymp√§rist√∂j√§ suojeltavaksi ja kansainv√§lisi√§ kaivoslupia lakkautettavaksi (solidaarisuudessa alkuper√§iskansojen maaoikeustaistelujen kanssa) ja toisella edellytt√§√§ kaikille 7 miljardille maapallon asukkaalle utopian, johon kuuluu lis√§√§ √§lypuhelimia, tietokoneita, droonikuriireja ja robotteja; kaikkea sellaista, joiden valmistamiseksi uusia kaivoksia jatkuvasti avataan‚Ä¶ Vaikka ‚Äúluksus‚Äù koetetaan kirjassa s√§√§llisyyden nimiss√§ m√§√§ritell√§ pikemminkin ajank√§yt√∂n kuin kulutustason kautta, jotenkin kummallisesti tuon vapautuvan vapaa-ajan t√§ytyy olla l√§pikotaisin teknologia-avusteista‚Ä¶ Mist√§√§n visioista ei pid√§ tinki√§! √Ñl√§ sano ‚Äúluopuminen‚Äù, alkaa jo ahdistaa! . . . . . . . (Muuten: k√§yt√§n t√§ss√§ esseess√§ termi√§ ‚Äúteknologia‚Äù ep√§tarkasti: oikeastaan pit√§isi puhua fossiilisista teknologioista. Ovathan vaikkapa puuvene ja biodynaaminen viljelykin teknologioita, joskin erilaisessa energiaregiimiss√§ syntyneit√§, ja siten olemukseltaan eriluonteisia. T√§rke√§lt√§ tuntuu kuitenkin korostaa, ett√§ k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ kaikki nykyisin k√§yt√∂ss√§ olevat digitalisoidut huipputeknologiat ‚Äî droonikoneet, avaruussukkulat, iphonet ‚Äî ovat l√§pikotaisin fossiilisia teknologioita.

Voittopuolisesti uusiutuvia energianl√§hteit√§ k√§ytt√§v√§ (hypoteettinen) yhteiskuntarakenne ei n√§et kykene tarjoamaan paikasta ja ajankohdasta riippumatonta, tasaj√§nnitteist√§ ja yht√§jaksoista, halpaa energiansy√∂tt√∂√§.

Paikoin teoksessa ‚Äî eritoten esseess√§ ‚ÄúToisenlainen maailmanloppu on mahdollinen‚Äù ‚Äî l√§hennyt√§√§n kyll√§kin ajatusta, ett√§ er√§s l√§ntisen tulevaisuuden- ja edistysuskon perustekij√§ on ollut voimakas talouskasvu, joka puolestaan on pohjimmiltaan perustunut fossiilisille polttoaineille, eritoten √∂ljylle.

Sit√§ hidastamisen, supistamisen, paikallistamisen ja kohtuullistamisen hylk√§√§vill√§ akselerationistisilla visioilla ‚Äî luksusavaruuskommunismi mukaanlukien ‚Äî ei ole. . . . . . . . Ilmastokriisi on ‚Äúmielikuvituksen kriisi‚Äù, nyky√§√§n kuulee toisteltavan. Fraasin voi tulkita kahdella tavalla. Voi joko pysytell√§ hyv√§tapaisen Yle-journalismin sis√§ll√§ ja ymm√§rt√§√§ fraasin tarkoittavan, ett√§ tilanne on p√§√§ssyt √§itym√§√§n niin vakavavaksi, ett√§ tarvittaisiin √§kki√§ tosipaljon hyvi√§ idiksi√§. (Joita ei kuitenkaan tunnu tulevan riitt√§v√§sti, mik√§h√§n siin√§kin on?) Vaihtoehtoisesti voi astua l√§ntisen innovaatiomentaliteetin ulkopuolelle ja riskeerata ajatuksen, ett√§ kriisi piileekin ehk√§ mielikuvituksessa itsess√§√§n: se ‚Äúedistykseen‚Äù pohjaava ideaalisen utopiakuvittelun moodi, joka yhteiskunnallista toimintaa on moderniteetin mittaan voittopuolisesti ohjannut, on kenties itsess√§√§n ‚Äúongelma‚Äù. L√§ntinen, teknis-utooppinen mielikuvitus unohtaa toistuvasti jotain. Ehk√§p√§ luovuuteen, ekspansioon, valoon ja vapauteen pohjaava utopiarakenne onkin sin√§ns√§ hybrinen. Katastrofi ei kenties synnyk√§√§n mielikuvituksen puutteesta, vaan sen liiallisesta, harkitsemattomasta ja yksipuolisesta k√§yt√∂st√§. Planetaarisen ekologian n√§k√∂kulmasta yhteiskunnallisen mielikuvituksen ongelmana ei totisesti ole, ett√§ viime vuosisadan modernististen utopioiden henki olisi p√§√§ssyt sammumaan. Pikemminkin se loistaa edelleen aivan liian kirkkaana: jokaisessa √∂ljykent√§n kaasusoihdussa, jokaisessa √§lypuhelimen n√§yt√∂ss√§‚Ä¶ . . . . . . . Er√§s ainoa TAALHK-keskustelussa vastaan tullut j√§rkev√§npuoleinen kommentti tulee Katri Immoselta, Laura Hallikkaalta ja Lauri Punam√§elt√§. Voiman nettisivuilla hiljattain julkaistun tekstin mukaan Ruumiillisuuden pit√§√§ olla keskeist√§, kun visioidaan elinkeinoja ja taloudellisia suhteita. Millaisia asioita ruumiimme tarvitsevat, ja miten valmistamme tarvitsemamme asiat kollektiivisesti niin, ett√§ se ei ole pois muiden ihmisyhteis√∂iden, eli√∂iden tai ekosysteemeiden tarpeista? Ruumiina olemme riippuvaisia ymp√§r√∂iv√§st√§ materiaalisesta maailmasta, ja viime k√§dess√§ hyvinvointimme riippuu niist√§ ekosysteemeist√§, joiden osana el√§mme. Ekosysteemit mahdollistavat keskin√§isen huolenpidon, ja ekosysteemeist√§ huolehtiminen on keskeinen osa kaikkea ihmisist√§ huolehtimista. Kaikilla ihmisill√§ joka puolilla maailmaa pit√§√§ olla yht√§ suuri oikeus el√§√§ ja huolehtia muista ymp√§rist√∂ss√§, jossa esimerkiksi maa, ilma ja vesi ei tee sairaaksi. Toisin sanoen, kirjoittajat nostavat keski√∂√∂n ‚Äî aivan oikein ‚Äî ruumiillisuuden ja hoivan. T√§rke√§√§ t√§ss√§ on havaita, ett√§ keskin√§isriippuuvuus ja hoiva eiv√§t nimenomaan rajoitu sosiaaliseen sf√§√§riin. Laajimmassa mittakaavassa kaikkein v√§ltt√§m√§tt√∂mint√§ ‚Äúhoivaty√∂t√§‚Äù tekee ‚Äî p√§√§osin n√§kym√§tt√∂miss√§ ‚Äî itse elonkeh√§. Se pit√§√§ meit√§ yll√§ uudistaessaan maaper√§n ravinteet, varjellessaan lajien monimuotoisuutta, kasvattaessaan ja pit√§ess√§√§n elossa sieni√§, marjoja, puita ja mehil√§isi√§. T√§m√§ ekosysteemien ‚Äúpime√§ ty√∂‚Äù edelt√§√§ kaikkea inhimillist√§ tuotantoa, kaikkea kulutusta, kaikkea kehityst√§ (ja taantumusta), kaikkea hoivaa ja uusintamista. Se jos mik√§ tapahtuu t√§ysin automaattisesti. Ja toden totta, siihen meid√§n olisi viimein k√§√§nnett√§v√§ katseemme. . . . . . . . Mutta tokihan TAAHLK puhuu hoivasta! minulle vastattaneen. Kyll√§, aivan niin. Ja siksi tuntuukin niin kummalliselta, ett√§ se tarvitsee teknologiaperusteista visiointia, ‚Äúsuuria kollektiivisia projekteja‚Äù ja ‚Äúitsetarkoituksellisen vaikeaan ryhtymist√§‚Äù. Mik√§li l√∂ys√§ teknoutopismi riisuttaisiin teoksesta pois, j√§ljell√§ olisi samaistuttava, monitahoinen ja itsetietoisessa joutilaisuudessaa kertakaikkisen miellytt√§v√§ esseeteos, jonka nykyolemiseen kohdistuviin analyyseihin voisi ottaa moninaisia suhteita. Esseen ‚ÄúSairaus ja voima‚Äù masennuskuvaus tulee iholle, ja muutenkin poliittisten, taistelevien subjektiviteettien kuvauksesta voi poimia paljon. Mutta teoksen utopismi tuntuu ylim√§√§r√§iselt√§, pakonomaiselta lis√§kkeelt√§. Se vaikuttaa pakokeinolta; kielii pikemminkin haluttomuudesta seisahtua, altistua, pys√§hty√§, ajatella ja aidosti vastustaa fossiilista modernia. Min√§ koen samaa haurautta ja huteruutta, samaa neuroottisuutta jota tekstiss√§ kuvataan. Mutta minun ratkaisuni on toinen. Min√§ ajattelen, ett√§ fossilisen neuroosin voi h√§ivytt√§√§; yliteknologisesta addiktiosta voi parantua. Ja suunta josta etsin vastausta on allap√§in. . . . . . . . TAAHLK etsii kuin etsiikin jotain perustaa. Ja l√∂yt√§√§kin sen: sille ‚Äúkommunismin materiaalinen pohja‚Äù on ‚Äútuotannon jakamisessa‚Äù. Mutta rivien v√§liss√§ k√§y selv√§ksi, ett√§ puhe on tuotannon jakamisesta nimenomaan ihmisten kesken. Yhteiskunnallisen olemisen perusta ei sittenk√§√§n paikannu biosf√§√§reihin ‚Äî siihen, mit√§ Salminen ja Vad√©n kutsuvat asubjektiiviseksi ‚Äúeloksi‚Äù. Ja t√§ss√§ alkaa paljastua jokaisen uudenkin marxilaisuuden √§√§rimm√§inen raja: el√§m√§n ilmi√∂. El√§m√§ itsess√§√§n on se alkuper√§isen hoivan matriisi, josta me ‚Äî paitsi yksil√∂in√§ my√∂s yhteis√∂in√§ ‚Äî olemme nousseet. Eiv√§tk√∂ mets√§t ole jo meid√§n ‚Äút√§ysin automatisoidut‚Äù hiilenpoistoj√§rjestelm√§mme? Eiv√§tk√∂ mikrobikannat ole jo meid√§n ‚Äút√§ysin automatisoidut‚Äù ruoansulattajamme? N√§ist√§ ‚Äúj√§rjestelmist√§‚Äù huolehtimisen tulisi nykyisess√§ katastrofaalisessa tilanteessamme olla ensisijaisia prioriteettejamme; ei uusien, monimutkaisten ja hauraiden energia-, teknologia-, ja huoltointensiivisten verkostojen rakentelu metallista, hiilikuidusta ja muovista. Hoivaa tulee korostaa. Se ei kuitenkaan saa harhauttaa luulemaan, ett√§ hoivan perusta olisi pohjimmiltaan mit√§√§n ihmisl√§ht√∂ist√§ tai ihmisen hallintaan sulkeutuvaa. Elonkeh√§n j√§rjestelm√§t eiv√§t ole mit√§√§n yhteisomaisuutta. Ne eiv√§t kuulu kenellek√§√§n, eiv√§t edes kommunistiselle v√§elle. Elonkeh√§n kutsuminen omaisuudeksi ‚Äî edes jaetuksi sellaiseksi ‚Äî on harhaanjohtavaa ja vaarallista. ‚ÄúYhteisen‚Äù rikkauden ja runsauden ‚Äî siis ihmisolentojen nautinnan alueeseen kuuluvaksi mielletyn ymp√§rist√∂n hedelmien ‚Äî taustalla velloo viel√§ jotain toista, viel√§ v√§hemm√§n kenellek√§√§n kuuluvaksi muotoutuvaa: vierasta, kuhisevaa, ei-hy√∂dyllist√§-eik√§-hy√∂dyt√∂nt√§, aidosti autonomista. My√∂s mielipuolista, satunnaista ja vaarallista; mutta juuri sellaisena el√§m√§lle v√§ltt√§m√§t√∂nt√§. Tai oikeammin, el√§m√§√§ itse√§√§n. . . . . . . Jonkin aikaa sitten luin (j√§lleen kerran) er√§st√§ lempikirjailijaani, William S. Burroughsia. Billin 60-luvulla kirjoittamissa mainoissa esseiss√§ ‚Äî joita muuten luetaan n√§hd√§kseni aivan liian v√§h√§n ‚Äî t√∂rm√§sin omituisiin teeseihin. We postulate that man is an artifact designed for space travel. What you experience in dreams and out of the body trips, what you glimpse in the work of writers and painters, is the promised land of space. Lausumat j√§iv√§t vaivaamaan. Mist√§ t√§ss√§ oli kysymys? Miksi Burroughs, jonka poliittiset mielipiteet ovat kuvailtavissa l√§hinn√§ √§√§rianarkistisiksi, ja joka yleisesti ottaen oli eritt√§in skeptinen kaikkea sek√§ valtio- ett√§ korporaatiol√§ht√∂ist√§ valtaa ja teknologiaa kohtaan, koki avaruuden ‚Äúluvattuna maana‚Äù? Mist√§ Bill oikein t√§sm√§lleen ottaen fantasioi? Vastaus purkautui esiin hiljalleen. K√§sitin, ett√§ Burroughsin el√§m√§nmittainen haave oli paeta kaikenlaista hallintaa, kontrollia niin pitk√§lle kuin pippuri kasvaa. Burroughsille kaikenlainen riippuvuus, dependency, edusti pakkoa, kontrollia ja ulkopuolista invaasiota. Pitih√§n Bill jopa kielt√§ ja tietoisuutta sin√§ns√§ vieraslajeina tai viraalisina parasiitteina. Rajusti opiaattiriippuvaisena Bill haaveili koko ik√§ns√§ paikasta, jossa kaikki riippuvaisuus, kaikki hallitsemattomille ulkoisille voimille alistuminen viimein lakkaisi. Ajatusmallit t√§h√§n pakenemisen projektiinsa h√§n poimi periamerikkalaisesta rajaseudun tematiikasta: eteenp√§in ja ulosp√§in on ainoa suunta, jonne paranoidi burroughsilainen subjekti voi koskaan mielekk√§√§sti pyrki√§. Pakeneminen, hinnalla mill√§ hyv√§ns√§. Loogisesti ajateltuna liike johtaa avaruuteen. Pakeneminen, aina vain pakeneminen, mihink√§√§n kytkeytym√§tt√∂m√§n vapauden etsiminen, aineettomaan tyhji√∂√∂n saakka. Avaruus edustaa siis burroughsilaiselle subjektille √§√§rimm√§ist√§ emansipaatiota. Se on paikka, jossa kaikki riippuvuudet ja altistumiset ovat vihdoin rauenneet. Paranoidi irtautumisen haave muuntuu oikeastaan kuolemantoiveeksi: irrottakaa loputkin kiinnikkeet. ‚Äì Ironista t√§ss√§ on tietenkin se, ett√§ avaruuteen siirtyminen tarkoittaa k√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ t√§ysin p√§invastaista: avaruusmatkailuhan edellytt√§√§ de facto kaikkien paon ja kapinan mahdollisuuksien tukahduttamista, t√§ydellist√§ kontrollille altistumista. Avaruusasemalla tai -aluksessa, jos miss√§, ihminen on t√§ydellisen kytk√∂ksiss√§ ‚Äî t√§ydellisen riippuvainen ymp√§r√∂iv√§st√§ teknisest√§ j√§rjestelm√§st√§; j√§√§nn√∂ksett√§ insin√∂√∂rien, suunnittelijoiden, ohjelmoijien ja tietokoneiden varassa; l√§pikotaisin tarkkailtu, l√§pikotaisin hallinnoitu‚Ä¶ Harvalla ihmisell√§ koko maailmanhistoriassa on ollut yht√§ v√§h√§n liikkumavaraa kuin Juri Gagarinilla tai Neil Armstrongilla. Vankilasta tai orjaplantaasilta voi sent√§√§n karata. . . . . . . Burroughsin paranoidi visio, jossa riippuvuuksia, pakkoja ja kontrollimekanismeja l√∂ytyy kaikkialta, ja jossa niit√§ kaikkia on ikuisuuksiin paettava, osoittautuu k√§√§nt√∂puoleltaan mielipuoliseksi kykenem√§tt√∂myydeksi altistua millekk√§√§n; osaamattomuudeksi sitoutua mihink√§√§n keskin√§isriippuvuuden verkostoon. Pyrkimys paeta kaikkia riippuvuuksia onkin √§√§rimm√§isimm√§ss√§ muodossaan pyrkimyst√§ paeta kaikkia kytk√∂ksi√§ ‚Äî kaikkia liitoskohtia subjektia ymp√§r√∂iv√§√§n el√§m√§nkuhinaan. Mutta me riipumme peruuttamattomasti muusta el√§v√§st√§. Yhteis-elo on keskin√§isriippuvuutta. Avaruus on t√§m√§n keskin√§isriippuvuuden vastakuva. . . . . . . Tietenkin ajatus ei-inhimillisiin ekosysteemeihin sitoutumisesta, niist√§ huolehtimisesta saattaa kuulostaa ahdistavalta: edellytt√§√§h√§n se, ett√§ ihmissubjektin autonominen ja luova, harhaileva ja lorviva halu joutuu aina aika ajoin alistumaan jollekin itsens√§ ulkopuoliselle vaateelle. Pit√§√§ j√§tt√§√§ kaikenlaista tekem√§tt√§. Puutarhaa t√§ytyy kastella, kasvimaata kitke√§ ja el√§imi√§ ruokkia omista mielialoista ja toiveista huolimatta. Kuitenkin ekologisen keskin√§isriippuvuuden ja -tarvitsevuuden vaalimisessa saattaa piill√§ jokin viisaus, joka automaatioentusiasteilta liihottaa ohitse. ‚Äì Sama p√§tee muuten kaikenlaiseen sosiaaliseen toimintaan, kuten lasten-, vanhusten- ja vammaistenhoitoon. Vaikka sit√§ ei monen tekisik√§√§n mieli sanoa √§√§neen, lapsista huolehtiminen ei ole suurimman osan aikaa erityisen vapauttavaa tai v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ edes kivaa; mutta heid√§n hoivaamisensa pit√§√§ sis√§ll√§√§n ehdottoman, ohittamattoman velvoitteen, jonka t√§ytt√§minen on ainakin omasta mielest√§ni itseisarvoista. (Sama koskee ‚Äî voin my√∂s omasta kokemuksestani kertoa ‚Äî erityisesti vammaisten hoitoty√∂t√§.) Hoivaan sis√§ltyy riippuvuuden ja vastuun muotoja, joihin asettuminen edellytt√§√§ ihmiselt√§ subjektiivista rajoittumista, l√§hikuvaan asettumista, luopumista, halujen vaivalloista uudelleenkalibrointia. Mutta joka my√∂s antaa paljon. Jokaisen eteen tarjoutuvan emansipaation kohdalla olisikin kysytt√§v√§: mink√§ t√§hden ‚Äî ja mihin ‚Äî sit√§ ollaankaan vapautumassa? . . . . . . Ja t√§ss√§ TAAHLK:n kuvaama haurauden ja riippuvaisuuden kokemus poikkeaa omastani. Min√§ koen olevani etup√§√§ss√§ luonnonolosuhteiden kannattelema elonkappale, hutera liham√∂hk√§le. Luksuskommunistinen ihminen ei t√§t√§ vastoin tunnu virtaavan lainkaan ulosp√§in toisiin lajeihin, el√§imiin tai kasveihin, ei ylisukupolvisiin perinteisiin tai velvoitteisiin; h√§n ei yhdisty l√§hiluontoon, ei hetkeksik√§√§n sulaudu ekologiseen taustaansa. H√§n pikemminkin et√§√§ntyy siit√§ edelleen, erilaisten teknologisten v√§lineiden avulla ‚Äî mieluimmin avaruuteen asti. Juurtuneisuuttaan ekosysteemeihin luksusihminen tuntuu v√§lttelev√§n, sit√§ olletikin taantumuksellisena j√§√§nteen√§ pit√§en. Maaseutua kohtaan h√§n tuntee l√§hinn√§ ylenkatsetta tai huvittunutta ivaa, mik√§li yleens√§ mit√§√§n. Jos johonkin, h√§n perustuu kommunistiseen hoivaan ja jakaa olemisensa l√§himpien kaupunkilaistoveriensa kanssa; elollisesta, ei-inhimillisest√§ ymp√§rist√∂st√§ h√§net on kuitenkin kokemuksellisesti leikattu irti kuin veitsell√§, eik√§ elonyhteis√∂ist√§ tai luontokokemuksesta puhuta luksusutopiassa halaistua sanaa ‚Äî muuten kuin ep√§m√§√§r√§isen h√§vityksen dystooppisena maisemana. Jopa kysymys ruoan tuottamisesta j√§√§ kummallisen avoimeksi. Vegaaniherkut ja kaviaari ilmeisesti vain tulevat jostain‚Ä¶ (T√§ss√§ ei tietenk√§√§n ole mit√§√§n uutta. Engelskin katsoi Englannin perinteisen maaseutuv√§est√∂n el√§neen ennen teollista vallankumousta ‚Äúihmisarvotonta el√§m√§√§‚Äù. Kyliss√§ vuosisataista el√§m√§ntapaa noudattaneet ihmisryhm√§t olivat Friedrich-sed√§n mukaan ‚Äúhenkisesti kuolleita‚Äù, √§√§li√∂m√§isen tyytyv√§isi√§ ‚Äúhiljaiseen kasvinel√§m√§√§ns√§‚Äù; ravinnon alkutuotantoon aikansa k√§ytt√§nyt v√§est√∂ ei oikeastaan ‚Äúollut ihmisi√§ ollenkaan, vaan pelkki√§ ty√∂koneita‚Äù‚Ä¶) Myyttien kertomisessa ei sin√§ns√§ ole mit√§√§n vikaa. Omasta mielest√§ni on kuitenkin koko lailla ilmeist√§, ett√§ jokaisen mielekk√§√§n fossiilikapitalismin j√§lkeisen utopian tulisi edes yritt√§√§ ajatella suhteensa vanhoihin k√§sity√∂l√§isteknologioihin ja ‚Äúmaalaisiin‚Äù el√§m√§nmuotoihin uudelleen. Esimerkiksi paikallisuuden, l√§hiruoan tuotannon, luomuviljelyn tekniikkojen ja hajautetun asuinrakenteen edut alkavat hauraan, fossiiliteknologisen infrastruktuurin ysk√§hdelless√§ hahmottua yh√§ selke√§mpin√§ esiin. Valitettavasti TAAHLK tulee sittenkin toistaneeksi modernisaation ikiharmaata antroposentrista virtt√§. Kuten nuorelle Marxille, TAALHK:lle ihmisen ‚Äújuuri‚Äù on sittenkin aina vain ‚Äúihminen itse‚Äù, ja tuotannon radikaali kommunistinen jakaminen tarkoittaa edelleen ihmisen itsens√§ ‚Äî tuon luomakunnan yl√§puolelle kohotetun puolijumalan ‚Äî sosiaalisen itsetuotannon prosessia, johon ei-inhimillinen luonto p√§√§see mukaan vain raaka-ainesubstraattina. Jos edes sellaisena. . . . . . . . El√§m√§√§ ei ole mahdollista tuottaa teknologisesti. Edes yhden elollisen solun valmistaminen ei-elollisista elementeist√§ on t√§ll√§ haavaa teknologisen j√§rjestelm√§n ulottumattomissa, ja jokin minussa toivoo, ett√§ se tulee sit√§ olemaankin. Kaikki el√§v√§n aineksen ‚Äútuottaminen‚Äù on joka tapauksessa aina vain jo olemassa olevan el√§m√§n manipulaatiota. Jokaisen ekosysteemin, biomin, lajin, yhteiskunnan, my√∂s oman teknologis-kapitalistisen organisaatiomme olioituvat hahmot nousevat jo ennalta olemassa olevasta el√§m√§n kudoksesta. Se on meid√§n pime√§ juurakkomme, tausta josta kohoamme ja johon ennen pitk√§√§ vajoamme takaisin. El√§m√§n ilmi√∂ on meille yh√§ mysteeri, niin tieteellisesti kuin taiteellisesti ja ennen kaikkea poliittisestikin. Tuota ilmi√∂t√§ meid√§n tulisi, aina edelleen, kuunnella, hoitaa ja hoivata. Kuvitelma siit√§, ett√§ teknologinen yhteiskunta ‚Äî kommunistinen, kapitalistinen tai mik√§ hyv√§ns√§ muukaan ‚Äî voisi m√ºnchausenilaisittain nostaa itsens√§ yl√∂s ambivalentin, monihaaraisen elollisuuden suosta on harha. Toki se on suosittu ja sangen yleinen harha‚Ä¶ Enk√§ sin√§ns√§ lainkaan ihmettele TAAHLK:n ymp√§rille kertynytt√§ kuhinaa. Totta kai on helpompi kiinnitt√§√§ ihmisten katseet sinne, minne ne jo vuosikymmenten mittaisen kulttuurillisen ehdollistamisen my√∂t√§ on suunnattu ‚Äî avaruuteen, robotteihin ja luksusel√§m√§√§n ‚Äî kuin sinne, mit√§ yhteiskuntarakenteemme jatkuvasti ty√∂nt√§√§ syrj√§√§n sit√§ h√§ik√§ilem√§tt√∂m√§sti h√∂ykytt√§√§kseen. Metsiin, soihin, niittyihin, tuntureihin, vesist√∂ihin. Marginaaliin eiv√§t teknosivilisaation piiriss√§ painu nimitt√§in vain masentuneet, v√§hemmist√∂t ja syrj√§ytyneet, vaan n√§it√§kin ennen ja ‚Äî anteeksi nyt vain ‚Äî n√§it√§ verrattomasti t√§rke√§mpin√§ primaariset elonyhteis√∂t: sienet, kasvit, el√§imet, bakteerit, sammalet. Kerta toisensa j√§lkeen unohduksiin, pois n√§k√∂kent√§st√§ katoavat ne bioottiset ennakkoehdot, joiden varassa kaikenkarvaiset visiomme ja unelmamme lep√§√§v√§t. T√§t√§ unohdusta, poispainamista ja v√§h√§ttely√§ TAAHLK ‚Äî syyntakeettomana kenties, naiivin kosmonautin katsein, mutta sit√§kin brutaalimmin ‚Äî edelleen jatkaa. Haluaisin kokea toisin. Haluaisin olla v√§√§r√§ss√§. Mutta en voi olla aistimatta, kuinka tekstiss√§ kaikuvat pohjimmiltaan vanhat tutut Vuoden 1844 k√§sikirjoitusten antroposentriset perusj√§sennykset. Nuorelle Marxille ihmisen ja luonnon ‚Äúaktuaalinen‚Äù, varsinaisesti vaikutusvaltainen ja tosi suhde on ‚Äúteollisuus‚Äù. Ounastelen, ett√§ useimmat uusvasemmistolaiset visiot tuntuvat minusta niin kovin ahdistavilta eritoten siksi, etteiv√§t ne yrit√§ vakavissaan kuvitella mit√§√§n t√§m√§n tilalle. Eip√§ toisaalta kommunismi ‚Äî miss√§√§n lukuisista variaatiostaan ‚Äî ole ikin√§ varsinaisesti yritt√§nytk√§√§n kehitt√§√§ mit√§√§n vaihtoehtoista tapaa luonnonel√§vien kanssa olemiseen. . . . . . Kirjaa voi todella vilpitt√∂m√§sti kehua sen kepe√§st√§, teoreettista ja henkil√∂kohtaista yhdist√§v√§st√§ tyylist√§ . Silti sit√§ lukiessa pist√§√§ syd√§meen, ja syyn√§ t√§h√§n on juuri mainitun kepeyden alkul√§hde: TAAHLK haluaa kovasti olla voittajien filosofiaa. Ja siin√§ se on loppujen lopuksi onnistunutkin. Kaikesta sarkastisesta kapitalismikritiikist√§√§n huolimatta se on kuin onkin fossiilisen modernin korkeimmalla huipulla ratsastavien vision√§√§rien kyvyk√§st√§, voimannuttavaa ja stimuloivaa ajattelun virtaa, jonka er√§√§n√§ tarkoituksena on todistaa ennen kaikkea jonkinlaisesta post-nietzschel√§isest√§, seitsem√§√§n kertaan ironisesti kielletyst√§ mutta silti hyvinkin maskuliinisesta voimasta. Ekspansiosta, valovoimaisuudesta, joutilaisuuden mukanaantuomasta vapaaherran luovuudesta. Ja sitten p√§in vastoin: sitoutumisesta, keskin√§isest√§ huolenpidosta, riippuvaisuudesta, el√§m√§nvarjelusta, kunnioituksesta, kohtuudesta tai luopumisen etiikasta se puhu juuri mit√§√§n. Ajatus paikallaan pysyvist√§, ylisukupolvisista ja paikallisista, itse√§√§n rajaavista ja ekosysteemej√§ kunnioittavista el√§m√§nmuodoista on sille anathema. Sen on p√§√§st√§v√§ ennen pitk√§√§ karkuun. Niinp√§ sen esittelem√§ avaruusutopia likeneekin kaikista hienoista ja kannatettavista poliittisista avauksistaan huolimatta fossiilimodernin hyv√§ksik√§ytt√§mi√§, retusoituja ideaalikuvia. Se on vaarassa ajautua jatko-osan jatko-osaksi sille eksergiselle, laajenevalle l√§nsimaiselle utopiaprojektille, jota Ursula Le Guin kutsuu osuvalla nimell√§ the big yang motorcycle trip. Kielt√§ytyminen, laiskottelu ja pakeneminen kun k√§√§ntyv√§t kovin helposti solaarisen laajenemisvimman, kyvykkyyden ja lorvehtivan voiman ihailuksi. Utopia has been Yang. In one way or another, from Plato on, utopia has been the big yang motorcycle trip. Bright, dry, clear, strong, firm, active, aggressive, lineal, progressive, creative, expanding, advancing, and hot. Esimerkiksi: kirjan Slush-esseen itsetietoisen ironian ja kritiikin l√§pi tihkuu rahtunen aitoa riemua siit√§, ett√§ on saanut olla huipputapahtumassa mukana. Ett√§ tavalla tai toisella on p√§√§ssyt koskettamaan tulevaisuutta ‚Äî sellaisena ett√§ siihen voisi ehk√§ tosissaan uskoa. On p√§√§sty mukaan isojen poikien p√∂ytiin. Kyll√§h√§n transhumanistiset startupparit lopulta ymm√§rt√§v√§t kapitalismin uusimpia muotoja ja tulevaisuutta paremmin kuin ekonihilistit ja sen sellaiset. Kaiketi Slush on kommunistin silmiss√§ monella tapaa ongelmallinen; mutta ei tapahtumaa esseess√§ suinkaan kehystet√§ tuhoon tuomitun, ylivelkaisen ja globaalisti yh√§ rankemmaksi √§ityv√§n ymp√§rist√∂- ja sosiaalikuormituksen alla kamppailevan tuhoj√§rjestelm√§n viimeiseksi ep√§toivoiseksi yritykseksi pit√§√§ tsemppihenke√§ yll√§. Ei, TAAHLK:lle Slush todella edustaa edistyst√§, apatiasta poisp√§in viev√§√§ liikett√§. Ainakin kaikkialla sen ulkopuolella ‚Äútulevaisuus on peruttu‚Äù. Luksuskommunistin teht√§v√§n√§ lienee sitten transponoida Slushin transhumanistiset ja -planetaariset visiot sosiaalisesti oikeudenmukaisiksi, emansipatorisiksi joutenolon v√§lineiksi. N√§in TAAHLK on pohjimmiltaan Slushin peilikuva, sen immanentti korrektiivi ‚Äî innovaatioliikkeen sis√§ist√§ kritiikki√§. Antti Nyl√©n toteaakin, toisessa yhteydess√§ mutta silti viilt√§v√§n osuvasti: Ep√§ilem√§tt√§ kunnianhimoisimmille nuorille vasemmistolaisille pohdiskelijoille onkin luvassa melko mukavat oltavat ideoiden heittelij√∂in√§ uudessa merkitystaloudessa, joka tarvitsee tauotonta hyvien pointtien, visioiden, ‚Äúrohkeiden avausten‚Äù energiansy√∂tt√∂√§. En toki v√§it√§, ett√§ t√§m√§ olisi se paikka, jota TAAHLK tahtoisi joutua pelaamaan. Mutta siihen se, paha kyll√§, on vaarassa ajautua. . . . . . . Ei, min√§ en ole avaruushomoluksuskommunisti. Ehk√§ haluaisin olla. Mik√§li minulla olisi enemm√§n teoksen intomielisesti hehkuttamaa nietzschel√§ist√§ kyvykkyytt√§ ja voimaa, en kenties murehtisi niin paljon. Kenties voisin unohtaa meditaatio- ja hiljenemisharjoitteet, luopumisen ja v√§hent√§misen praktiikat, kamppailut el√§imellisen tiedostamattoman pimeiss√§ sy√∂vereiss√§. Saattaisihan jostain olemukseni perukoilta olla kaivettavissa viel√§ aktiivinen usko siihen, ett√§ energiahuumaantuneen yhteiskunnan unelmat eiv√§t ole viel√§ uneksuttu loppuun; ett√§ ne voi tosiaan viel√§ transponoida uudeksi vapautumisen aalloksi, yhteisen tekemisen suunnattomaksi vimmaksi. Saattaisin olla fiksumpi ja kyvykk√§√§mpi. Kenties kirjoittaisin kaikesta herpaantuneesta laiskottelustani huolimatta enemm√§n kirjoja. Tekisin kiinnostavampaa taidetta. Kuka tiet√§√§? Mutta en min√§ pysty siihen. Min√§ olen liiaksi kiintynyt. Kiintynyt omaan keholliseen rajallisuuteeni; kiintynyt v√§syv√§√§n, toipuvaan, biologiseen ja kuolevaiseen itseeni; kiintynyt ja sitoutunut omaan perheeseeni, vanhempiini, lapseeni, kumppaniini, omaan sukuhistoriaani; kytkeytynyt henkisesti minulle t√§rkeiden paikkojen l√§hiluontoon; olen aivan liian riippuvainen biofysikaalisesta paikastani n√§iss√§ konkreettisissa keskin√§isen riippuvuuden verkostoissa voidakseni hyl√§t√§ kaiken ‚Äúpaikallisuuden‚Äù, voidakseni vet√§√§ naapurigalakseihin ulottuvia ‚Äúpaon viivoja‚Äù, voidakseni tuosta noin hyl√§t√§ oidipaalisen is√§suhteeni purkamisen m√§lsyyden ja ‚Äútehd√§ jotain aivan muuta‚Äù. Olen kokenut liian voimakkaasti pyhyytt√§ lapsuuteni luonnonymp√§rist√∂iss√§; liiaksi kasvanut kiinni tunteeseen, ett√§ minussa virtaa katkeamatta sama elo, joka on virranut vanhemmissani ja esivanhemmissani, ja heid√§n kauttaan kaikissa planetaarisen el√§m√§mme ‚Äî ainoan tuntemamme el√§m√§n‚Äî aikaisemmissa sukupolvissa halki evoluution rihmastojen, l√§pi lintujen, nis√§kk√§iden, mustikoiden ja rahkasammalten jaettujen esihistorioiden aina ensimm√§iseen protoplasmaan saakka. Eik√§ n√§ist√§k√§√§n kiintymyksist√§ mik√§√§n tule kest√§m√§√§n, se on selv√§√§. Irtip√§√§st√§minen on jossain mieless√§ v√§ltt√§m√§t√∂nt√§ ‚Äî sill√§ me kaikki muutumme, vanhenemme ja kuolemme. Jok‚Äôikisest√§ luettelemastani asiasta minun tulee ennen pitk√§√§ luopua, tulevathan ne katoamaan kuten kaikki elollinen ja ajallinen. Ennen pitk√§√§ tulen p√§√§st√§m√§√§n irti kaikista kiintymyksist√§ni ja juurtumisistani, se on selv√§√§. Mutta min√§ aion harjoittaa luopumista niin, etten kaipaa tilalle yhtik√§s mit√§√§n, en yht√§√§n droonia enk√§ robottia. Minun maailman-, ei, minun el√§m√§nkuvani perustuu t√§m√§n ymm√§rt√§miselle; elonkeh√§√§n sitoutumiselle, hiljenemiselle, irtip√§√§st√∂lle, luopumiselle, kokonaisuuksien tunnistamiselle ja niist√§ huolehtimiselle, niin pitk√§√§n kuin se on mahdollista. Minusta ei ole vapautumaan yhden planeetan tyranniasta; minusta ei ole uskomaan tulevaisuuteen, jossa kaikilla on 3D-tulostimet ja jossa luonto on ensin aidattu lainausmerkkeihin ja sitten lopullisesti unohdettu, automatisoitu tai sulautettu kyborgij√§rjestelm√§√§n. Min√§ j√§√§n maan pinnalle. . . . . . . Pari viikkoa sitten t√§t√§ teksti√§ luonnostellessani satoi lunta. Poikkeuksellisesti Helsingin nykyoloihin n√§hden se pysyi kerrankin maassa, l√§mp√∂tila kun roikkui t√§p√§r√§sti nollan alapuolella. T√§llaiset taianomaiset p√§iv√§t ovat t√§t√§ nyky√§ sangen harvinaisia, ja harvinaisemmiksi k√§yv√§t; jokaista p√§√§kaupungin t√§ytt√§ talvip√§iv√§√§ arvostaa nyky√§√§n l√§hes pyh√§n√§, tiet√§en ett√§ se voi vallan hyvin olla viimeinen. L√§hdin siis k√§velylle l√§hist√∂lle Kumpulaan, vanhoihin lapsuudenmaisemiini; niihin pieniin kaupunkimetsiin, joiden kupeessa olen viime vuosina onnistunut asumaan. (Kuinka kauan se nousevien tonttivuokrien ja gentrifikaation paineessa on mahdollista, kukapa tiet√§√§.) Keskell√§ Kumpulaa nousee hyvinvointivaltion huippuvuosina, 60-luvulla rakennettu K√§til√∂opisto. Runsas vuosi sitten tuo valtava rakennelma, koko lapsuuttani kehyst√§nyt massiivinen hoivan monumentti tuomittiin perinpohjaisesti homehtuneeksi ja m√§√§r√§ttiin purettavaksi. Nyt tuo likaisenruskea valtiollisen hyvinvoinnin muistomerkki seisoo tyhjill√§√§n, ikkunat mustuuttaan kiillellen. Harhailin K√§til√∂opiston taakse, vanhalle K√§tt√§rinm√§elle ja sen metsiin. Kuljin pitkin niit√§ harvoja mets√§nnokareita joita Helsingin alueella viel√§ on j√§ljell√§ ‚Äî hyvin tietoisena siit√§, ett√§ n√§m√§ pikku l√§ntit ovat etel√§suomalaisesti katsottuna viimeisi√§ j√§√§nteit√§ kerran niin runsaista ja monimuotoisista mets√§ekosysteemeist√§; hyvin tietoisena siit√§, ett√§ joka kaavoituskierroksella n√§it√§ pieni√§ kaupunkimetsikk√∂j√§ kavennetaan kaupungin kasvuvaateiden tyydytt√§miseksi; hyvin tietoisena siit√§, kuinka er√§√§tkin luksuskommunistisesti asennoituneet sielut ovat somekeskusteluissa nimitt√§neet n√§it√§ p√§√§kaupunkiseudun viimeisi√§ pikku luontolaikkuja ‚Äúryteik√∂iksi‚Äù, joiden kaataminen ihmisasutuksen tielt√§ on kerrassaan ‚Äújees‚Äù. Edistyksen nimiss√§ kaikenlainen lieneekin sallittua. Poikkesin lumen pehmustamassa metsik√∂ss√§ polulta; nietokset vaimensivat ymp√§r√∂iv√§n kaupungin kumun. Hetkisen aikaa saatoin ajatella taivaan harmaan kaaren sulkeutuvan yll√§ni kupoliksi. Liikennev√§ylien √§√§net et√§√§ntyiv√§t kuulumattomiin. Metsik√∂n keskelle aukeni √§kisti paikka, jonka saattoi hetkisen verran kuvitella olevan kenties ainoa maailmassa. Lumipeitteiset oksat sulkivat n√§kym√§n ulommas; puurivist√∂jen ja oksastojen rivit tuntuivat jatkuvan p√§√§ttym√§tt√∂miin. √Ñkki√§ olin tilassa, joka oli taianomaisesti irtaantunut ymp√§r√∂iv√§st√§ fossiilihurrikaanista. Se kellui jossain muistojen, haaveiden ja maaper√§√§n tallentuneiden muinaisten maisemien v√§lill√§. Olin mets√§npeitossa; toisaalla. Silloin ymm√§rsin jotain: min√§ tarvitsen t√§t√§ paikkaa. T√§t√§ paikkaa, t√§t√§ fantasiaa yh√§ j√§ljelle j√§√§v√§st√§mets√§st√§ ‚Äî kuvitelmaa elonyhteis√∂st√§, joka pit√§√§ hiljaa ja huomaamatta itse√§√§n yll√§ katastrofista huolimatta. T√§m√§n voimalla min√§ pysyn k√§ynniss√§ olevassa kosmisessa mielett√∂myydess√§ mukana. Siin√§ seistess√§ni kuvittelin taivaalle, jonnekin pilvipeitteen taakse avaruusraketin ‚Äî sen, jolla huristetaan ‚Äútornadon l√§pi toiselle puolelle‚Äù. Paikkansa kullakin. Ja kukapa min√§ loppujen lopuksi olisin kritisoimaan sit√§, mit√§ kukin oman henkisen p√§rj√§√§misens√§ kannalta tarvitsee. . . . . . . . Jostain alkoi kuulua rytmik√§st√§, kumeaa √§√§nt√§. Naputtelua. Ter√§stin aistejani. Alas hankeen leijaili kaarnankappale. Lopulta ymm√§rsin katsoa yl√∂s. Se oli palok√§rki. Komea, lihava ja puuhakas. Ensimm√§iseni. (Olen l√§himetsiss√§ni tutustunut viime vuosina useisiin k√§pytikkoihin. Er√§skin tuttu, eloisa yksil√∂ asustelee kelohongassa Mets√§l√§n ja Oulunkyl√§n v√§lisess√§ pieness√§ kuusikossa. Mutta palok√§rke√§ en ole onnistunut Helsingiss√§ viel√§ n√§kem√§√§n.) Vaikka palok√§rki onkin Suomessa rauhoitettu, ei se ole erityisen harvinainen tai vaarantunut: lintutietokannan mukaan niit√§ on Suomessa kolmisenkymment√§tuhatta pesiv√§√§ paria. Saman verran ihmisi√§ tulisi TAAHLK:n mukaan keskitt√§√§ yhdelle neli√∂kilometrille asumaan, mik√§li paikasta halutaan muovata eloisa, valovoimainen, rihmastoinen ja j√§nnitt√§v√§ Great American City. Tikka loikki pet√§j√§n latvuksissa. Siell√§ se ratkaisi el√§m√§√§ omalla tavallaan, minusta piittaamatta. En saanut ilmi√§ni otuksesta irti. Sen rapistelun rytmit poukkoilivat siirtolapuutarhan aidoista, lopulta hankeen vaimetakseen. Huomasin itkev√§ni. . . . . . . Minun on helppo samaistua TAAHLK:sta huokuvaan haavoittuvuuteen, ep√§varmuuteen ja prekaariuden kokemukseen. Ne min√§ tunnistan ja ymm√§rr√§n. Sen avaamia visioita minun taas on vaikea pit√§√§ ominani. Kirja tuntuu uneksivan kuolevan fossiilikapitalismin unia. Niist√§ on tuskin kovinkaan kest√§viksi rakennuspalikoiksi tulevalle kasvun ja konsumerismin j√§lkeiselle energiakrapulaiselle el√§m√§lle; el√§m√§lle ilmastosekasorron keskell√§, lajik√∂yh√§ll√§ ja vaurioituneella planeetalla. Mutta mit√§ sitten, jos ei avaruusraketteja? En min√§ tied√§. Varmuutta ei ole mist√§√§n. Tuskin tied√§n sit√§k√§√§n, miksi kirjoitan t√§t√§. Olen yht√§ eksynyt ja olosuhteiden riepoteltavissa, yht√§ kapitalistiselle hurrikaanille altis kuin kuka hyv√§ns√§ muukin. Ja kristallipalloni lienee yht√§ sumea ja naarmuinen kuin kenen hyv√§ns√§. Joka tapauksessa tulevaisuus on todenn√§k√∂isesti jotain aivan toista kuin mik√§√§n kuvittelemamme. Mutta yh√§ jokin vie minua kohti l√§himets√§√§. Enk√§ t√§ll√§ hiljalleen k√∂yhtyv√§ll√§ maaper√§ll√§ edelleenk√§√§n muuta osaa kuin kysy√§ Ursulan mukana: What would a yin utopia be? Ja sitten kuunnella, kun Ursula vastaa: It would be dark, wet, obscure, weak, yielding, passive, participatory, circular, cyclical, peaceful, nurturant, retreating, contracting, and cold. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*T4hhMofQJkvemamU., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*T4hhMofQJkvemamU., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*T4hhMofQJkvemamU."

The internet arrived and soon after, online job search portals were all over the place; LinkedIn launched in 2003 and is now lookup guide of every recruiter. Continuing the trend, here are the top 3 technology advancements recruitment industry is looking up to: 1) Big Data ‚Äî It can help to predict hiring needs of companies in real-time. A specific branch of it called People Analytics can further help a recruiter to analyse the data of great talent already existing in the company in order to predict the skills needed to succeed in a specific role. This approach is ought to be much better than the hard skills focused job descriptions we have today. 2) Contextual search- It refers to searching and analysing what the candidate is looking for ‚Äî much beyond what they type. A great opportunity is often missed since search function of the tools we use today rely solely on limited boolean criterias. New age tools like Textkernel and Spotle are much more smarter in understanding what the candidate wants to convey. 3) Gamification- It is the process of adding game mechanics to non-gaming contexts. By integrating gamification in common interview processes, a recruiter has the opportunity to introduce fun games and interactive quizzes. This approach has the potential of making the screening mechanism more conversational, entertaining and meaningful.

Many of the accounts I have seen attacking the ad on Twitter over the last few days have 30 followers and no histories. A friend of mine, Natasha Stromberg of GenderBuzz tweeted this: ‚ÄúBe aware of trolls around the #GiletteAd. Just talk to the wonderful men in your own lives and trust that they ARE the change. Positive change IS happening for men & for women, & fortunately there are more of us who support it than don‚Äôt.‚Äù https://twitter.com/genderbuzz/status/1085540915186409474 This tweet from Natasha is the central thrust of my article, so you can stop here if you like. We already know about Russian troll farms attacking the 2016 and 2018 U.S. elections, Brexit and the French elections and so on, driving targeted messages of bias and anger at millions of accounts in the US and overseas. These operations don‚Äôt stop just because there is no pending election. Why wouldn‚Äôt they seek to shore up political divisions around volatile public debates like those with the Gillette ad? And manhood is a particularly volatile space for sewing divisions. Those of us working in the manhood space have already come to understand that radicalized masculinity dialogues are a gateway into white nationalist recruitment and so on. All which serves to create political instability. And if you remain skeptical that foreign troll farms are working full time to tip the scale of our political and social landscape, how about this article at Slate? From the article:Forget the 2016 presidential election, Russia may have interfered in something far more serious: the discourse surrounding The Last Jedi, the Star Wars movie directed by Rian Johnson. A new study by researcher Morten Bay examines online discussion of the film and finds that on Twitter, the discourse was affected by ‚Äúdeliberate, organized political influence measures disguised as fan arguments,‚Äù including by possible Russian trolls. In ‚ÄúWeaponizing the Haters: The Last Jedi and the strategic politicization of pop culture through social media manipulation,‚Äù Bay collected and analyzed tweets that directly addressed Johnson and were sent over a period of eight months, beginning with the day of the movie‚Äôs European release. Bay found that just 21.9 percent of the 967 tweets he examined were negative, suggesting that the movie may not be nearly as divisive as the backlash made it seem. More disturbingly, Bay also found that of that more than half of the negative tweets may have come from ‚Äúbots, trolls/sock puppets or political activists using the debate to propagate political messages supporting extreme right-wing causes and the discrimination of gender, race or sexuality.‚Äù Until we wake up and realize how deeply into our social fabric these foreign and domestic political agents are drilling down, they will continue to use social media to poison our perception of our politics, our culture and each other. My background in dealing with volatile online dialogues goes way back. I have been writing about fatherhood and manhood for the Good Men Project for a decade. The Good Men Project remains one of the leading voices in the conversation about manhood. Millions of men and women are there every month, having ‚Äúthe conversation no one else is having.‚Äù When I first starting writing there, the conversation now one else was having often got very binary and very, very nasty. As early members of the GMP writers community, we spent our days in the binary crossfire of the gender wars, responding to the comments of angry people, men and women alike. Many of us carry a form of PTSD, having been accused, attacked, and threatened by the most aggressive voices the net has to offer for years on end. To this day, whenever I see a new comment on my posts, I reflexively steel myself for a possible onslaught. Writers for the GMP, especially women, often got burned out, drawing back from the public conversation about masculinity, because they could no longer take anonymous online abuse that often included threats of rape and assault against them or their families. Fast forward to now. Things remain volatile. I am not without my own sins and my own expressions of frustration and anger. But while my expressions of rage have typically been spontaneous outbursts, generated in the back and forth heat of the moment, there is something new going on these days. Something much more calculated and manufactured. As of the last couple of years, the GMP no longer allows open commenting. If you want to join the conversation, you have to become a member. You have to be an identified participant in the conversation. And‚Ä¶ eureka, the nasty, abusive, threatening voices are gone. As if they never existed. When I asked GMP publisher Lisa Hickey about the choice to end open commenting, she told me something interesting. She said that she no longer wanted to provide a platform where white supremacists could come and recruit. ‚ÄúThey look for angry male voices in comment threads and then white nationalists reach out and say, ‚Äòyes, you should be angry and here‚Äôs some other things you should be angry about,‚Äô‚Äù she said. For me, this casts a new light on the angriest voices commenting on my own articles. When they call me a cuck, a traitor, a liberal pussy and what not, I raise my eyebrows, aware now that they either may be at risk for being recruited, or, depending on how the comments are worded, they may be baiting a hook for others. Sometimes, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on when someone is melting down online, but other times it is quite clear. This comment I am about to share with you, which arrived as a result of an article I wrote about mansplaining? This right here? This is boilerplate white racist recruitment. I‚Äôm posting this person‚Äôs comments as a jpeg so it won‚Äôt come up in text searches. I will restrict myself to my comments here, not posting any pull quotes. But I am going to share this person‚Äôs words in this limited way. I think it is important for us to deconstruct how calculated performances of anger (right down to all caps) are used as a recruitment tool everywhere from our social media streams to our U. S. Senate hearings. Here is the post. I would like to make a few observations about this post. The author doesn‚Äôt acknowledge the theme of my article at all. It‚Äôs likely they didn‚Äôt read it. What they do is use what seems to me to be a boilerplate, angry, emotional message to deliver in a very calculated way, themes of white nationalism. What we have here is a calculated performance of rage, designed to create the impression of a deeply personal emotional response while delivering talking points that are coldly calculated. This use of emotion to invite assimilation of political ideology is nothing new. We‚Äôve seen it before. Always in totalitarian states. Always from tyrants. Here‚Äôs the screen grab of my commenter‚Äôs profile on Medium. They have zero followers and are following no one. They had only two comments, one directed at me. Perhaps they came and started a new account just for little old me? This commenter is clearly advocating for the very issues which drove the the approval of Brexit, and current anti immigrant feeling in the US, thus improving the likelihood that this voice could be associated with a foreign power who is seeking to destabilize western nations by stoking racist sentiments. I have blocked this person from my Medium account. According to Medium ‚ÄúIf you block the author of a response, it will not be linked from anywhere on your post, for anyone.‚Äù Twitter says, ‚ÄúTweets from blocked accounts will not appear in your timeline.‚Äù More importantly, when we block angry voices, we insure we won‚Äôt be tempted to respond, spreading them into our stream. Facebook has plenty of tools for managing rageful voices. Hide is one of my favorites, block is even better. The performance of male rage around issues of masculinity, gender and equality is tied to racist recruitment across social media. Racists are casting a net for those who might be susceptible to recruitment into white nationalism, their vulnerability fostered by uncertainty, anger and fear. Along with the press and the larger media, we all have to be very mindful when rage and anger are being used in calculated ways to suppress more civil discourses or to co-opt the news cycle. We have to understand how abuse online is used to exhaust and deplete us. To get us to say, ‚Äúoh the hell with it, I don‚Äôt want to challenge this stuff any more.‚Äù Meanwhile, the next time you‚Äôre tempted to engage a troll on the internet, ask yourself, am I talking to a white nationalist recruiter? Am I talking to someone on a troll farm seeking to grow divisions between us? We have to use our judgement in terms of who we engage and who be block. I spend a lot of time engaging on the net in an attempt to create a better conversation about manhood, but when someone comes at me with no interest in dialogue, clearly just performing rage and anger? I think block is the gold standard for those folks. Don‚Äôt feed the trolls is actually don‚Äôt feed the white nationalists. Don‚Äôt feed the troll farms. Because every raging voice we respond to is extended by our social network, giving them an opportunity for recruitment or to stoke more division. I take this position not because I‚Äôm obsessed with some conspiracy theory about trolls. I actually take it as a frame by which I to encourage us to not think ill of our fellow human beings. When someone posts something particularly cruel or nasty about something as seemingly hopeful as the Gillette Ad, and then I visualize a living breathing person who could be living a few blocks from me, it is deeply alarming. ‚ÄúWhat is WRONG with people?‚Äù I might ask. But when I visualize some operative at a troll farm working off a spread sheet of approved comments for the issue of the day, I feel much better. ‚ÄúSome of the online rage is just manufactured. It‚Äôs not a real human being. It‚Äôs fake.‚Äù In this way we can resource ourselves and grow our sense that our fellow human beings are on the right side of history. So, fake news? How about this. Fake rage. -- -- 8 Working toward a culture of healthy masculinity. Links to our books, podcasts, Youtube and more: http://linktr.ee/RemakingManhood.

This fascination has led me to pursue music, experiment with Chaldni plates and work on developing pro audio and acoustic noise cancellation systems as a hobby in my undergraduate years. At Siemens, my current organization, we work on developing cutting edge digitalization solutions for industry. Our teams develop predictive and prescriptive analytic solutions for the plant floor while also integrating it with state-of-the-art technologies such as Augmented and Virtual reality. Indeed, the ‚ÄúSound‚Äù bug bites me again! What better application than Industrial Augmented reality to implement voice user interfaces?. As a product owner though, it is a part of my job to ensure that such decisions are not taken on gut feeling but rather, a clear analytical approach that is data driven. So, is a voice user interface really the next big thing on the plant floor? Let‚Äôs read on to find out! Augmented reality has existed for the past 30 years or so, taking off in the late eighties, but, Industrial Augmented reality has always been a path which was tread upon cautiously. The hardware has traditionally been fragile, bulky and cumbersome and was poorly suited to a plant floor routinely exposed to harsh environmental conditions. The latest generation AR devices are compact and well suited for industrial applications. There are several manufacturers whose AR offerings include IP 66 rated as well as intrinsically safe AR devices for hazardous environments. In terms of convenience, Augmented reality hardware has sure come a long way. From this study by PTC, the developers of the Vuforia augmented reality platform, it is seen that the major attractions to the industrial customer are applications that involve augmented operator assistance in carrying out complex procedures such as equipment servicing, maintenance and assembly or disassembly. For an industrial environment, and applications listed above, lets apply classic design thinking principles to evaluate whether a voice user interface would be the right fit here. But before that, lets briefly talk about interacting with Augmented reality. ‚ÄúHuman-computer interaction‚Äù is the field that focuses on the interaction between humans (the target user) and the computer. Much of the research in ‚ÄúHuman-computer interaction‚Äù deals with improving the usability of computer interfaces. We see how this evolved from interaction methods such as Punched cards in the earlier days to keyboards and mice, to touch based systems that are all the rage now. Similarly, there also exists interaction methods such as voice user interfaces and gesture control which is often also referred to as a touch-less user interface. In this excellent study by PwC, they quote that the dominant interaction methods for Augmented reality and Virtual reality are yet to be established. As we are now briefly acquainted with human-computer interaction methods, lets dive straight away into our analysis without further ado. For this, I started with interviewing maintenance technicians at my previous organization, Jindal Power limited which is a record setting thermal power plant with 3400-Megawatt total power generation capacity. As the inputs received from each of them were essentially the same, I have consolidated these inputs to create a persona of the target user for our AR solution. Here is what it looks like below. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want quarter-inch drill bits. They want quarter-inch holes‚Äù ‚Äî Leo McGinneva. Putting it another way, People don‚Äôt just buy stuff. They buy what stuff does for them. With this in mind, and the persona template compiled earlier, lets list down the jobs to be done. We can do this using a simple sentence structure that reads, ‚ÄúWhen/While _________I want________So that I can_______. 1) ‚ÄúWhile I am servicing field equipment in a physically tough location, I want a hands-free method of referring to service manuals So that I can continue working on the equipment without having to come down to a more conducive environment or lay my tools down‚Äù. 2) ‚ÄúWhen I am performing an equipment start up procedure, I want to have guided step by step instructions in a hands-free environment So that I can perform the procedure quickly with minimized chance of errors‚Äù. 3) ‚ÄúWhen I am performing instrument calibration online, I want to be able to see the readings at the control room on my device So that I don‚Äôt have to contact the operator at the control room to tally the field readings with him‚Äù. The third step towards finalizing the best mode of interaction with the AR device in an Industrial environment would be to chalk out our value proposition. This is also known as the ad-lib elevator pitch format and goes like this ‚ÄúOur____Helps____Who want to_____by____and_____unlike______‚Äù As we are not clear yet, which interface method would be the best fit in an Industrial AR solution, I will modify this statement to read as follows:- ‚ÄúOur AR interface method Should help maintenance technicians Who want to easily interact with the AR device by using a hands-free method of interaction and increase their convenience unlike existing interface methods‚Äù. As all data is compiled now, decision making should be a piece of cake. As ‚ÄúHands-free‚Äù is a recurring requirement, lets eliminate touch-based interfaces for now. We are now left with two modes of interaction, touch-less user interface also called gesture control and voice user interface. Lets quickly weigh the pros and cons of each against each other. From a user‚Äôs perspective, a voice user interface seems a good fit for industrial augmented reality applications such as these. The advanced reader will immediately note that this was a very basic assessment and several functional and non-functional requirements like security, scalability, extensibility, etc. were left out in this comparison. I leave it to the reader to take this article as a starting point while deciding on the best user interface for industrial augmented reality. The best solution could very well be a combination of two-three different types of user interfaces. For example, a voice user interface combined with a touch-based interface.

If you think this is just a ploy to get your attention, please give me a minute. I‚Äôm hoping this piece will be a little different from the other predictions you‚Äôve read recently. Today humans live in a hyper-connected matrix that is always on, regardless of what device they use. Technology drives human advancement, and the rapid pace of change is blurring the lines between the ‚Äúdigital‚Äù and the physical world. Every facet of our lives has some form of technological foundation that is becoming smarter and/or more powerful. In business terms, this change is called ‚Äòdigital transformation‚Äô. Essentially it is a foundational transformation that is disrupting the way business, society and economies interact. The biggest change is that digital transformation puts customers at the epicentre of business. Today consumers enjoy more power and influence than they‚Äôve ever had before. At this transformative time, research shows that humans are becoming a lot less trusting. The 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer reveals a crisis of ‚Äúfaith in traditional authority figures and institutions‚Äù. This at a time when technological development brings with it significant opportunities but is not without risk. Trust is important because it enables faster innovation, and increased human adoption of technology. Trust is the enablement of progress, but one in which all players need to assess and contribute to the building of trust. At a time when trust is declining and is simultaneously a key future driver, the big questions marketers need to ask themselves is what they‚Äôre doing to break, or build, trust with the people who matter to them most. 2. Consultancies Will Dominate Everyone‚Äôs talking about the death of advertising and big agencies, but this doesn‚Äôt reveal what comes next. The recent acquisition of Droga5 by Accenture Interactive has caused quite a stir, but has been a long time coming. I‚Äôd say that Droga5 won with this one, getting a pretty good deal! I‚Äôve always maintained that consultancies could wipe out agencies by simply offering the same services at a heavily discounted fee ‚Äî they have the resources to do this, but not necessarily the talent, which is why an acquisition like Droga5 makes sense. I believe consultancies will win the race because of how digital transformation is increasing the rapid rate of innovation. The big consulting firms have had huge experience in change management at a time when most CMOs have lost their way, thanks to ad agencies that are failing because they‚Äôve failed to transform their own business models. Marketing is automating while becoming more fluid and pivotal in the overall business strategy. It‚Äôs no longer about unmeasurable and fluffy metrics like ‚Äúbrand equity‚Äù, ‚Äúengagement‚Äù or ‚Äúeyeballs‚Äù. The role of marketing now is understanding customers like never before, through data and insights. And, of course, by building personalised communications with the aim of garnering trust and further understanding. Companies that do this well will become the customer-centric leaders of tomorrow. Consultancies tend to be more insights-driven. They facilitate change easily and are abreast of emerging developments. The big consultants ‚Äòhold‚Äô their client‚Äôs business strategy, a role that agencies have failed to conquer. But where consultancies fall short is in execution, often leaving this up to the clients themselves. That‚Äôs why the Droga5 acquisition makes perfect sense for Accenture Interactive ‚Äî it shores up a dominant position. The logical next step for them would be to acquire data companies and platforms, as well as employ deeper technological, analytical and creative thinking skills. 3. The return of Google Not that Google has gone anywhere, but its advertising revenue has definitely been affected by the big social media companies. Yes, I know their ad spend is increasing, but this is due to clients spending larger portions of their budgets online. Budgets that, less than a decade ago, Google could have captured almost entirely. Social media ad spend will decrease, in proportional terms (that is as a percentage of online ad spend), in the coming years. Why? Given this, it is only natural that social budgets will shift back to performance marketing platforms like AdWords, where a return is more measurable, more real, and audiences are more engaged. Unlike social media companies, Google has such a strong moat as a business ‚Äî there are few, if any, search businesses that can compete with it (in the Western world). The bottom line? The marketing sector is going through a time of unprecedented change. But with this comes great opportunity. The level of change we are experiencing will recreate marketing for the better. A transformed business lives in service of its customers, and so too should marketing. Basically, technology is just helping us humanity hit the reset button. Advertising is responsible for a lot of damage to human trust. Now‚Äôs the opportunity to put things right, put customers at the centre of everything, and now to treat humans like humans. -- -- Signal or Noise is a monthly publication by marketing & technology entrepreneur Bradley Elliott which focuses on insights, technology and creativity and how they relate to business, marketing, money and the future.

Interviewed Justin Hamilton, who does public relations for Zipline. High maternal and child mortality rates, severe malaria, and anemia are only a portion of the problems that result from the blood shortage in Ghana. Currently, countries in Africa collect ‚Äúless than half of the blood needed to make transfusion requirements for their populations.‚Äù Access to blood remains a challenge in these countries. Zipline‚Äôs approach is to use autonomous electric drones to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand. Think of Uber or Lyft, but instead of transporting humans with cars, Zipline is flying packages of blood with drones. Doctors place their orders by messaging Zipline on Whatsapp, and within 30 minutes, medical supplies packaged from Zipline‚Äôs distribution centers are floating in the sky above the hospital by parachute in a hard-to-miss bright red box. So far, Zipline has set up its distribution centers in Ghana and Rwanda, but Justin Hamilton claims that Zipline‚Äôs ultimate goal is to ‚Äúprovide every human on Earth with instant access‚Äù to these medical supplies. In 2014, co-founder and CEO Keller Rinaudo visited the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. Hamilton states that in the health institute, Rinaudo ‚Äúmet a graduate student who had built a mobile alert system for health workers to text emergency requests for medicine and vaccines.‚Äù Despite allowing health workers to make thousands of emergency medical requests, the system was unable to actually fulfill these requests due to the lack of medical resources. Determined to make a difference, Rinaudo was committed to building a system where the urgent need for blood and medicine could finally be fulfilled. Having majored in Biotechnology and Economics as an undergraduate, it seems like Rinaudo‚Äôs vision to create a company that focuses on delivering medicine was planted as early as his early university years. Along with his co-founders, Keenan Wyrobek and William Hetzler, Rinaudo was able to create a system that took medical deliveries to the next level by using autonomous drones. Since its establishment, Zipline has delivered 16,000 and counting lifesaving packages by drone. According to Hamilton, building the autonomous is ‚Äúonly 10% of the complexity of the [entire] system.‚Äù He continues, ‚Äúsome of the biggest challenges of setting up a national drone delivery service involves integrating a public health supply chain and building all the infrastructure and equipment necessary to do 150 flights per day, reliably and routinely.‚Äù Hamilton claims, ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually very easy to build a quadcopter off the shelf and then make a delivery of a candy bar over 2‚Äì4 km in perfect weather. It‚Äôs really hard, however, to build a system that can operate at a national scale, fly in heavy wind and rain, and integrate with a much larger supply chain.‚Äù One question still lingers within my mind about Zipline. Zipline has made an undeniable impact on Ghana and Rwanda, however, it encounters the same questions that many Silicon Valley startups are facing. It seems as if the world is growing increasingly dependent on these tech startups, and the global wealth distribution is clustering around Silicon Valley. Rather than relying solely on Zipline‚Äôs beneficial services, developing countries like Ghana must also improve their own sustainable methods to solve the country‚Äôs deeper issues, like an efficient healthcare system. These problems require long-term investments in local infrastructure and human capital, rather than complete reliance on Silicon Valley companies. Although unintended consequences may arise in developing countries in the future, the work that Zipline is doing remains highly inspirational and undoubtedly, for a lack of better terms, cool and edgy. Rather than pondering on how to solve problems in first-world countries, Zipline is making an extraordinary step to bring innovative technologies to places that truly need it. To all the individuals who are seeking to find their place in the world, Zipline‚Äôs founders leave you with one line of advice: ‚ÄúTo solve global problems, we have to look outside our own experiences and ask, ‚Äòwhat kind of world do we want to live in?‚Äô‚Äù -- -- This is a series about game changers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcompanies and individuals who are redefining what it means to change the world.

That‚Äôs how much US-based companies spent on employee training and development in 2017. I was astonished by this figure ‚Äî and it made me think about how we can all improve our training and employee retention. In my experience, it always comes back to company culture. For example, I recently discovered Etsy School. Employees at the e-commerce company run a series of courses where they teach each other new skills. And they‚Äôre not just work-related activities, either. The courses include everything from coding and sewing to dancing the tango and mixing cocktails. I love this idea. Not just because staff can learn a variety of skills, but also because it brings people together in a light-hearted, yet informative setting. When employees are engaged with their workplace, studies have shown that productivity increases and the costs associated with training and employee turnover drop dramatically. And these costs are some of the most challenging for businesses to overcome. That‚Äôs because training programs are difficult to get right.

The earlier models had a steep learning curve when it came to piloting the robot around, especially when trying to avoid obstacles. This time around, navigation is a breeze as the Double 3 takes advantage of 3D sensors and cameras that allow users to point and click to their destination. The robot packs an integrated 9.7-inch integrated touch screen (gone is the iPad 2), and a wealth of other technology ‚Äî including six beamforming microphones, a pair of front-facing 13-megapixel cameras (one super wide-angle lens, one super zoom lens), and an 8-watt full-range speaker. On the sensor side, the Double 3 packs two Intel RealSense stereovision depth sensors, five ultrasonic range finders, two wheel encoders (2048 PPR each), and one 9-DOF IMU, all powered by an NVIDIA Jetson TX2‚Äì4GB SoC. The Double 3 robot uses that sensor array to provide users a slick mixed reality overlay of the environment, presenting a dot grid on the floor that enables users to click to where they want to go, much like the Sims video game. The robot can then proceed to the chosen destination while avoiding any obstacles in its path, which eliminates that strict piloting learning curve that came with the previous models. Another great feature lets users take control of the front-facing cameras that can pan, tilt up and down, and zoom in/out, making it easy to read documents on a desk or zooming in on presentations. The self-balancing mobility system with lateral control remains the same, which is excellent for Double 2 owners that want to upgrade, which is quickly enough done by replacing the head. The Double 3 is expected to launch in September with prices starting at $3,999.

While others were app-happy and always knew the latest Instagram gossip, I was reading a book or watching something on my laptop. And when I lit up the screen to discover 208 unread messages in group conversations, it reassured me that I was usually the last one to reply. Of course I was ‚Äî I hardly used my phone. But it was always there. Curled up in bed and reading the next chapter of my novel and there it lay a black screen in the corner of my eye. An episode of Mad Men wouldn‚Äôt be complete without my mobile sidekick taking its place on the sofa. Messages would light up while I cooked, wrote poetry and in the middle of the night, and every time I would swipe access with urgent reluctance and read the gist of the conversation, before promising to reply later. Before I knew it, my phone had become a mental crutch and I was double-checking every subtle reflection of light my eyes mistook for a pop-up message. From once being able to easily read a novel for hours, in ignorance of the whereabouts of any technical device, my attention had been dramatically shortened to the width of the iPhone 6 screen I was anxiously lighting up after every 3 lines. It meant that I could not dedicate my complete concentration to any single task, because my ultimate focus was my phone. Without it, I was missing something ‚Äî what if someone wanted to contact me urgently, for advice or communicate some information that required my absolute immediate attention? Of course, it was an irrational thought, but as my phone focus grew bigger, my world was getting subtly smaller. I wasn‚Äôt enjoying or living in the things I was doing in the present, but constantly watching and waiting for something else to happen, in the future and through a device and this was making me feel anxious. Perhaps the moment when I knew things had to change was when my mobile lost charge at the supermarket. Despite being a mere 10 minutes from my home and within the safety of a large shop, with lots of customers and staff, I distinctly recall the stomach-sinking anxiety that took a hold of my nerves. Bizarrely, I felt alone, disconnected from my family and friends, almost as though I was my own island. My heart beat faster before a fresh breeze of freedom came through to heighten my senses and awareness of my surroundings. For the first time in a long time, I was seeing and hearing everything with its outline, rather than the hurried smudge that often comes with always looking down. Grocery shopping stops being a mundane task when you notice the quality and colours of fruit and veg or the rainbow-sheen of salmon on the counter. So, that weekend I switched off my phone. I knew it would not be enough to simply turn it upside down in a drawer for the reason that I would know it was still on and definitely potentially receiving messages. Switched off, however, and I could sit there all day and the screen would still be black. It was the kind of break-up that I needed. Instantly, I felt a peace of mind just knowing that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about any messages or calls. I had already told my friends that I wouldn‚Äôt be available for the day and knew that if there were any kind of seriously unlikely urgent reason they needed to contact me, they had my Mum‚Äôs number. And then I went outside, to stand in nature and experience all of its outlines. It was a beautiful day and I bought potted flowers and learned how to make hanging baskets. Sure, at times my mind drifted to my phone, but, overall, I spent the day being more mindful of the outside world, the people around me and myself. I slowed down to create something that lasts and will grow and change every day and just looked up to breathe a bit deeper. It‚Äôs easy to think that if you‚Äôre not on social media every day or the frst person to reply on WhatsApp, that you‚Äôre not negatively affected by your phone, but the likely reality is that you are. Phones are so commonplace and central to the way we run our lives today that it‚Äôs difficult to mentally switch off. In fact, according to The Telegraph, we now spend an entire day a week online and check our phones, on average, every 12 minutes. While there is no doubt that they are useful, like most things, it‚Äôs all about balance, and knowing that the strongest connections are created without it. -- -- 7 Wellness copywriter at G.B.

It‚Äôs hard to comprehend what I just did and even harder to decide how I feel about it. But, this will be my attempt at doing just that. My name is John Galletta, and I‚Äôm a graduate of the Master of Science in Information Systems program at Drexel University. I recently completed an international rotational internship program at SAP and you may, perhaps, call me a risk-taker because I‚Äôve decided to take take a leap from a sure thing in an effort to advance my technical career. For those who are looking to challenge themselves, take a leap of faith, or achieve their own big hairy audacious goals (or BHAG‚Äôs), this is my story about my time as an SAP STAR Intern and the difficult decision I had to make to move on and pursue my next big move. Well, let‚Äôs get to the root of this quickly so I can try to explain how I felt as I went through the process of looking for jobs from within a major tech company, what it was like to be swarmed by recruiters on LinkedIn, and the factors I considered along each step of my journey. As a full-time master‚Äôs student at Drexel University in 2018, I qualified for the Student Training and Rotation (STAR) Program at SAP America Inc. For those who don‚Äôt know, SAP is a global enterprise software company with headquarters in Walldorf, Germany. The company specializes in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and is building upon an already impressive portfolio of integrated software solutions which serve the specific needs of various lines of business across 25 industries. As STAR Interns, my colleagues and I were given real-world responsibilities during our rotations through a custom procured selection of organizations within SAP. My first rotation was on the Analytics team in the Center of Excellence (CoE) located at the company‚Äôs North American Headquarters in Newtown Square, PA. During my time on this team, I was entrusted with the task of leading a team of three interns and one full-time developer in building a highly scalable platform for the creation, distribution, and tracking of training curricula for support engineers in North America all while learning about the company‚Äôs flagship analytical offerings: WebI, Business Warehouse, Business Objects, and SAP Analytics Cloud. Over the course of six months, my team and I went through design thinking, prototyping, entity relationship modeling, development, and deployment of the product using SAP UI5, SAP WebIDE, SAP Cloud Platform, and SAP HANA. The end product of this work, the SAP Training Dashboard, is currently being used to manage the onboarding and training of new hires in the company‚Äôs 6-month CoE Bootcamp program. My second rotation was a dual part-time role where I split my time between the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Solution Management Team and the Enterprise Analytics Customer Success Team. During my time on the solution management team, I was given the opportunity to participate in a week-long design thinking workshop led by the global team lead and participated in discussions regarding the various topics within the team‚Äôs scope. At this event, I was asked by the global lead to develop an analytical dashboard that would display the team‚Äôs KPI metrics on the wall in her office at global headquarters in Walldorf, Germany using SAP Analytics Cloud. While on the Solution Management team I was also presented with the opportunity to develop a multi-lingual chatbot using SAP‚Äôs Conversational AI platform, under the mentorship of the North America team lead and one of the team‚Äôs machine learning architects. The product of this work was shared with account executives who demonstrated its capabilities to potential customers in the State and Local Government and Education (SLED) sector. My last task on the Solution Management team was to present the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning portfolio to a group of approximately 20 C-level executives during a co-innovation partner workshop. This presentation outlined the capabilities of the solutions in the portfolio and included video demonstrations and teasers about what SAP‚Äôs machine learning solutions would be capable of achieving in the future. During my part-time rotation in Enterprise Analytics, I was blessed to work with amazing data scientists while they created statistical models to predict customer churn for the products in SAP‚Äôs portfolio and generated forecasts for the company‚Äôs service bookings. During this time, I helped enhance the team‚Äôs model deployment process by coordinating with a third data scientist located in Paris to generate a logging script to trace errors during deployment of their predictive models into company‚Äôs productive SAP Business Warehouse environment. During my first rotation in the STAR Program, an opportunity came up to lead an exchange program between the students at SAP America and SAP Hungary. I saw this as a way to demonstrate my leadership abilities while expanding the reach of my network to an even larger geographic area. With the help of the Vocational Training (VT) Exchange Program lead in Hungary, I started hosting a series of exchange calls between the US and Hungary which lead to the very first snack exchange between SAP America and SAP Hungary. During these exchanges, my colleagues and I took the opportunity to learn about foreign cultures while sharing our own equally foreign cultures with those abroad. As students in the STAR Program, each of us was given the opportunity to qualify for a three-month rotation abroad to the destination of our choice (as long as there was a role at the destination‚Äôs SAP office which made business sense for us to pursue). The work I had done, my contributions to the STAR Program, and overall ethic I had displayed during my first two rotations had qualified me for a rotation abroad. Since SAP SE (the global parent company of SAP) is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, it was a natural choice for me to pursue the open positions available there. After interviewing with many of the teams at headquarters, I decided to follow my passion for developing applications and pursue a role as a React UI Developer as part of a team whose manager reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer of SAP. Upon my arrival I was greeted by an executive assistant who showed me around the office and introduced me to our manager and the rest of the team. Under the mentorship of a User Experience Design Expert and a Senior UI Developer, I learned the ins and outs of developing web applications using React.js to further enhance my web development skill set and deliver a fully functioning asset library for the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúSAP Runs SAP‚Äù dynamic storytelling application. During the company‚Äôs annual SAPPHIRE NOW event in Orlando, Florida where our team‚Äôs application was being used to showcase SAP‚Äôs own use of SAP software ‚Äîand while all of the executives were away ‚Äî the team‚Äôs executive assistant took the opportunity to give me and my colleagues a tour of the company‚Äôs digital boardroom as well as building WDF49, the company‚Äôs newest and most innovative living workplace laboratory. This quickly became the most memorable part of my rotation in Walldorf. While abroad, I also had the opportunity to meet up with my manager and several colleagues for a weekend getaway in Oslo, Norway; enjoy the waters of Venice, Italy; visit the Mona Lisa, the Eiffel Tower and enjoy escargot in Paris, France; and spend time with family in Chisinau, Moldova. Needless to say, the entire rotation was a once in a lifetime experience. One thing worth mentioning about the culture of SAP is the closeness of its people. Guided by a unifying mission to ‚Äú help the world run better and improve people‚Äôs lives,‚Äù SAP‚Äôs culture is ethically aligned with what it means to be human. Part of this includes developing a strong sense of unity and oneness with those around you. To this end, the STAR Program provided us with excellent opportunities to share experiences together during team building trips to Skytop Lodge in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania and even take part in a variety of other activities together outside of work. This past summer, my team and I enjoyed playing paintball and participating in an ‚ÄúAmazing Race‚Äù style competition on the grounds of the resort. For me, working at SAP was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had. I made friends with over 100 people during my 1 year and 3 months at the company, received some of the best mentorship in the world, had absolutely the best manager ever, and even had the opportunity to be a mentor to others all while traveling the world and advancing my career. The people I got to work with are surely the best in the industry and I will and already do miss going in to the office to see them on a daily basis. But, all good things come to an end and this is where it starts to get hard for me to explain things. When it came time for me to choose a full-time position at SAP, I knew I wanted to remain technical, and I had already built a very strong network on a global scale with some amazingly talented people and an incredibly vast knowledge of SAP‚Äôs portfolio. I received a very generous offer for someone coming straight out of an internship program, but frankly, I knew I needed to keep pushing myself. The role I was offered was not as technical as I had originally anticipated and I knew that I wanted to keep climbing to new heights and take my passion even further. This led me to look for junior to mid-level developer roles I knew I could fulfill outside of the company. After listing myself as open to recruiters on LinkedIn, I was quickly able to understand what someone with my skills can do in the current job market. This is because over the span of two months I had been contacted by over 50 recruiters! The recruiter who was the most proactive, provided me with a technical skills assessment which assessed my skill level as a React developer as well as my technical knowledge of pure vanilla javascript. This helped both her and I find exactly the right position for me at a level that was right for the skillset I had to offer. I received honest feedback from that recruiter after meeting over coffee at a local Starbucks, and knew that I needed to pursue what was available to me. It‚Äôs not unlike me to know exactly what I want to pursue and set my sights on executing a strategic plan to attain it.

https://medium.com/@danalee_4649/buying-my-grandfather-airpods-2ff53bc79fe7?source=tag_archive---------150-----------------------,buying my grandfather AirPods,Written by idk,idk,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in idk Follow -- Listen Share A few weeks ago, my grandfather asked me to buy him a pair of Apple AirPods‚Ä¶ He was tired of his headphone wires getting in his way while working out and became very interested when he saw people at his local YMCA walking around with wireless earbuds. The thought of my grandfather walking around in public, flexing his AirPods made me laugh. Nonetheless, I brought down my AirPods and helped him try them out. After his free trial, he took out his wallet, gave me $200, and told me to buy him a pair by the next week. Ever since I can remember, my grandparents have visited my parents‚Äô house every single Wednesday morning. As the years have gone by my feeling towards their presence that one day a week evolved from pure excitement as a child, to bitter irritation during my adolescence, and to deep regret for not spending more time with them throughout college. After realizing how much my grandparents had aged and how little I truly knew them, I made it one of my top goals this gap semester to devote more quality time to them. However, even with this awareness and extra free time, I am ashamed to admit that there were a few Wednesdays that I did not even wake up in time to see them stop by. Thankfully, this all changed with the help of AirPods. The first day my grandfather received his AirPods, I taught him how to use bluetooth to connect them to his Android phone (Yes, he is using AirPods to listen to an Android phone LOL). I also downloaded an Android app to allow him to check his AirPod battery life. The last feature I taught him that day was how to use his AirPods to listen to videos and music he could search on YouTube. A small part of me wanted to leave him at that. I wanted him to learn the rest on his own and be free of teaching him the seemingly most basic steps in using a smartphone. However, another larger part of me knew that assisting him and teaching him the basics of music streaming technology would be both an ambitious and rewarding journey. The next Wednesday, he returned with several concerns. He was having difficulty keeping his AirPods in and asked if anything could be done. He ended up trading his AirPods with my brother‚Äôs Beats wireless headphones (which he eventually ended up switching back). After hearing that he wanted music to play non-stop during his workouts, I decided to download Spotify (non-premium) for him. I downloaded playlists for his favorite Korean artists such as Ïù¥Î¨∏ÏÑ∏ and Ï°∞Ïö©ÌïÑ. A part of me felt bad for enjoying the benefits of being a Spotify Premium owner, while watching my grandfather deal with annoying advertisements and the limited ability in choosing to play specific songs... The following week, he came back and switched back the Beats for the AirPods because he liked the AirPod look better (my grandpa got CLOUT). My dad also agreed to subscribe to the Spotify Family Plan so the whole family could use it (At the time, my brother, dad, and I were all sharing my personal Spotify premium account LOL). With Spotify Family, I taught both of my grandparents how to utilize the app and presented them the benefits of being a premium owner. I showed them basic functions such as searching for artists, making simple playlists, and shuffling songs. Every Wednesday, my grandfather comes over with a new question or concern about his AirPods or limited music selection. Although his ÏûîÏÜåÎ¶¨ (nagging) gets on my nerves at times, I am learning constant patience and more importantly showing my love for my grandparents, which has been extremely difficult to do with just words due to the language barrier. Sitting down on our family room couch and giving my grandparents the most simple technology lessons in my broken Korean allows for conversation to segue into even deeper conversation about life before I was born, memories we have together, and how my grandparents are doing in their daily lives. A few years ago, my grandfather refused to get a smartphone because he thought he‚Äôd die before he‚Äôd learn how to use one. Now, he has somewhat mastered the use of AirPods. It is truly amazing how technology can open doors for people of all ages and stages in life. If you have a parent, grandparent, or even a younger relative, who is struggling to use technology, I highly recommend being open to helping them out. You never where it will take you.

https://medium.com/@celiaongsl/designing-a-n-imaginary-school-app-on-a-smartwatch-a57b2c1bb959?source=tag_archive---------85-----------------------,Designing a(n imaginary) school app on a smartwatch,Written by Celia O,Celia O,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Celia O Follow -- Listen Share Smartwatches have come a long way since they started, expanding to allow for various functionalities from what we know on the phone into something way smaller and lighter. All around your wrist. And so, as part of a semester long module, I came up with the idea of creating an Apple Watch/smartwatch interface around what my group decided to tackle during the module ‚Äî an (imaginary) app interface intended for Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students to find seats around the various school libraries. Personally, I‚Äôve never had a go at designing smartwatch interfaces, so why not give it a shot now? When it came to deciding functionalities for the mobile application, we came up with ideas such as booking seats, personalisation of amenities and favouriting of libraries and also a seat forecast that takes into account both your preferred amenities and favourite libraries. To explain the seat forecast, I have to begin with the personalisation of amenities. This function meant that the student could choose around 3-4 amenities that they absolutely would require, for example a window seat, a charger for their laptop and phone, the distance from where they are or even to opt to use the library‚Äôs PC. They can also save libraries that they frequent. Once they have saved the information on the app, the app will filter out based on what is the best library that fits their amenities requirements, and from there, the number of fitted seats available will be reflected. For the seat forecast, it will use the number of fitted seats available over the total number of fitted seats to determine whether it will be a good or bad forecast. And if you‚Äôve saved more libraries, the ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù gets more complex to find you the best seat for you in school. For this challenge, I decided to go with the Apple Watch size of 42mm from the Apple Watch Series 3. I decided to scale down the functionalities and only show the seat forecast, along with a filtering function of your personalised amenities and favourite libraries. In the event that the student does not have favourite libraries, it will show a list of libraries ranked based on the amenities they‚Äôve saved. Version 1 (on the left) was done during the brainstorm process, whereas version 2 (on the right) was a second design proposal just for this post. There‚Äôs definitely a huge leap in terms of what each screen shows between versions, simply because after some research, it is best not to clutter the screen with too many words. Instead, to try and use visuals to represent those information. This way, it‚Äôll be easier to navigate through the interface whilst on the go. After planning, I came up with the final design, likening closer to the 2nd plan and with that in mind, let me explain with different scenarios to understand what sort of interfaces were needed. This user has saved 2 libraries from the app: the Lee Wee Nam library and the ADM library. The user has also saved 3 amenities that they would like for it to be reflected on the watch: plugs, window seats and discussion spots. When you click into the ‚Äúapp‚Äù on the watch, the watch will display a good forecast first, and the user can swipe left to see the libraries they‚Äôve saved, ranking the best libraries to study at, at the top. A progress indicator is used so that there‚Äôs a quick indication of how many fitted seats there are, that fulfils the 3 amenities the user requires. Plus, it will indirectly provide a gauge for the user to guess the quantity of fitted seats there are without having to display a number. Still, the user can tap into the library to see exact seat numbers. From there, they can head to the library. In this scenario, the app will display a bad forecast and a button will appear to suggest to the user better spots around the school that satisfies the amenities requirements. In the event that they still want to go to their favourite libraries, they can swipe to the next page to see it. From our surveys during the module, there were students that said the ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù might not be that helpful since they already like what they like, or already have plans to head to their saved library. Also that they might just head to their favourite library anyway and wait for an available seat. Which is why the option to view their initial saved choices is just a swipe away. If they tap into one of the libraries, they can actually reduce their amenities saved, to get a higher seat number. After all, all these 3 amenities are taken into account when finding seats, as the app assumes that the student wants/needs all 3 of them. In the event that the student doesn‚Äôt mind not having some of the amenities, they can adjust the filter by tapping the amenities buttons at the bottom and updating them. From there, an updated seat amount will be shown. In the event that the user doesn‚Äôt mind taking up the suggested libraries, the user can hit the ‚Äúrecommend me‚Äù button and suggestions will appear. Upon choosing one of the suggested libraries, the user has the option to get directions to that library, as it is likely that the library might be new to the user. The watch will vibrate to update the user to either walk, change direction or take public transport etc. The user can also manually update the map and the position with the button on the bottom left corner, and the map will be zoomed in or out correspondingly. I decided to keep this design and the functionalities simple because a smartwatch should be something you could quickly glance at without having to fiddle around too much. Which is why the amount of steps in each scenario is not a lot. Although it might mean that certain functionalities are not available, they can always turn to the mobile app to do more. This was definitely an interesting challenge and I do aim to do more (and maybe write more on this platform).

On Monday, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch four SoFi-branded, exchange-traded funds this year. Two of them, the SoFi 500 ETF (SFY) and SoFi Next 500 ETF (SFYX), will be fee-free until March 27, 2020. They carry a 0.19 percent management fee that their investment advisor has agreed to waive for the first year. SoFi is the latest fintech company to try to make a zero-fee splash in a market dominated by long-established legacy giants like Vanguard and BlackRock. But CEO Anthony Noto maintains that SoFi‚Äôs new push is not just a marketing scheme to lure high-earning potential customers. ‚ÄúThe offering we have today is meant to be the offering,‚Äù Noto told a group of reporters on Tuesday morning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not introductory, and it‚Äôs built on a five-year plan.‚Äù The new offering will sit under the SoFi Invest umbrella, which was made widely available to the general public Tuesday and to which SoFi plans to add cryptocurrency trading this year through a partnership with Coinbase, Noto said. ‚ÄúInvest and Money will both uniquely bring in new members that we wouldn‚Äôt have brought in through the lending products,‚Äù said Noto. ‚ÄúWithin Invest it‚Äôs hard to know if it‚Äôs going to be stocks, robo, ETFs or cryptocurrency. We know our members and nonmembers that fit our target want those different elements.‚Äù SoFi Invest is a free consumer investing service that offers stocks, ETFs, and robo-advising accompanied by newsy and educational content. Noto took the wheel at SoFi exactly one year ago, when the company was still a student loan refinancing brand battling the sex scandal that led to then-CEO Mike Cagney‚Äôs dramatic exit. In the past year the company has expanded and shifted to a mobile-first strategy. It launched Invest , a beta version of its personal finance manager, and SoFi Money, a fee-free bank account with a 2.25 percent interest rate. It plans to roll out a credit card, joint accounts, savings vaults, and roundups this year. In addition to its current life insurance offering, SoFi plans to expand to apartment insurance, car insurance, and more under the SoFi Protect umbrella, Noto said.. But 2019 is about ‚Äúnot just what we build, but how it works,‚Äù Noto said, in front of a slide introducing ‚ÄúThe New SoFi.‚Äù Specifically, it‚Äôs not just about the product rollouts, but about the membership and social experiences the company offers, like social events and career coaching sessions though a partnership with Korn Ferry. Noto said SoFi has specific partnership strategy and ambitions on the horizon, but none involve mergers and acquisitions. He noted that the fintech industry is still in its ‚Äúformation phase‚Äù of the investment cycle. He also said while in the long term SoFi strives to become a public company, an IPO is not a 2019 priority. The company‚Äôs product expansion is on trend with fintech companies that made their mark in the great unbundling of financial services and are now rebuilding them, thanks in large part to the high cost of customer acquisition. ‚ÄúThis is a great example of brand extension and SoFi can onboard wealth management customers at significantly lower onboarding costs than other robos which must acquire customers from scratch,‚Äù said April Rudin, chief executive and founder of wealth marketing strategy firm The Rudin Group. ‚ÄúIt is smart business and expected that SoFi would extend its play into wealth management services for its millennials borrowers. This cohort clearly needs wealth management advice and more financial literacy education.‚Äù Noto said one reason there hasn‚Äôt been a ‚Äúbroad-based‚Äù company in financial services „Éºlike in retail or travel, for example „Éº is due to the amount of capital required to operate. Many companies have launched individual products and achieved great success with it but haven‚Äôt expanded, which usually leads to M&A deals. ‚ÄúWe have a strategy where the success of one product will help drive the success of the next product, both directly and indirectly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are seeing the behavior from opening an account, funding an account, direct deposit and then spending ‚Äî that‚Äôs the path we want to see‚Ä¶ You can imagine us adding rewards programs overtime and economic opportunities with merchants.‚Äù -- -- Original reporting on social media, fintech, entertainment, cannabis, and more from the leading post-cable network.

Now What?,5 Important Steps to Help Your Business Respond Quickly and Safely,Daniel Rhodes,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Rhodes Follow Silent Breach -- Listen Share Unfortunately, successful cyberattacks are growing far too common. A 2018 study found that nearly 70% of SMBs have experienced a cyberattack in the past year, yet an astounding 47% of respondents said they ‚Äúhave no understanding‚Äù of how to protect themselves in the event of an attack. Due to the relative complexity of today‚Äôs digital infrastructure, most companies are moving towards Managed Security Services for digital protection and proactive security. In fact, Silent Breach estimates that partnering with a reputable cybersecurity firm is the single most effective step you can take to mitigate digital security risks and minimize security-related costs in the long run. Remember, protection is always cheaper and more effective before an attack takes place. However, if you believe that you‚Äôve been the victim of an attack, here are five critical steps you can take after the fact to immediately reduce your risk: The actions taken in the first few hours following a breach will continue have large ramifications throughout the remainder of the recovery, for better or for worse. It is therefore critical to consult with your prepared BCP before doing anything else. Most likely, your situation (or one sufficiently similar) has been forecasted and a series of processes and procedures have been developed to guide you along the way. While the average data breach costs close to $4 million, Ponemon‚Äôs latest Cost of a Data Breach Study estimates that having a Business Continuity Plan will save you $365,000 on average. On a per-file basis, the savings comes down to about $15 per compromised file. Although Business Continuity Plans should be specially tailored (in consultation with your cybersecurity partner) to your organizations needs and abilities, most effective BCPs will include the following 3 sections: Disaster Recovery: This will focus on recovering any IT resources and infrastructure that may have been compromised. Unlike natural disasters, cyberattacks are not constrained by geography, offering the attackers a distributed attack surface. DR for cyber breaches should prepare for targeted simultaneous outages. Business Impact Analysis: Not all breaches are created equal. A good BIA will account for interdependencies to ensure that resources are being deployed effectively and efficiently. Cyber Incident Response Plan: This will include a forensics unit composed of IT personnel (dedicated to tracking down and patching the breach), a regulatory unit of legal analysts (to identify and remediate compliance gaps), and a public relations team (to communicate with customers, the media and shareholders). If you do not yet have a Business Continuity Plan, use this Emergency Contact Form for access to Silent Breach‚Äôs Provisional Crisis Guideline for rapid triage and proceed immediately to Step 2. If you would like help developing your Business Continuity Plan, come and talk to us. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôve been breached. Cyberattacks often operate via the snowball effect, where each breach will trigger an additional, larger attack which will in turn do the same. It is crucial, therefore, that all infected devices be disconnected from your network as soon as possible. This will not only prevent the spread of the attack, but may also assist forensics experts in tracking down the cause of the attack. The importance of this step cannot be overstated. If you haven‚Äôt done so yet, contact your security partner and share everything you know about the breach as well as the affected systems and devices. Most likely, the security firm will have a 24/7 Security Operations Center which will work with you in real-time to mitigate the breach. If you do not have a security partner or are unable to reach them, note down everything you know (while the details are fresh) and immediately contact a security service provider for further directions. At Silent Breach, our security and forensics experts specialize in Incident Detection & Response and are available around the clock to assist you. Tip: Read our post on How To Choose a Cybersecurity Firm Deleting what you believe to be infected files will only make it harder for the forensics team to trace the attack and, in some cases, can even trigger a follow-up attack. In order to ensure that the attack can be fully discovered, contained and eradicated, it is vital to preserve the ‚Äòscene of the crime‚Äô. Hackers can take advantage of your identity by pivoting to attacks against business colleagues or personal contacts. Posing as yourself, they will use social-hacking techniques to convince close contacts to divulge sensitive personal information. Furthermore, under GDPR, stakeholders must be notified within 72 hours of a breach. To prevent this, immediately contact family members, friends and business associates to inform them that your account has been compromised. You can use social media or an email blast to quickly spread the word. For further assistance or to talk with a security professional, you can contact Silent Breach from anywhere in the world, at any time of the day.

https://medium.com/featured-insights/experimentation-helps-retailers-optimize-their-supply-chain-heres-how-b22fbfbb5421?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,Experimentation helps retailers optimize their supply chain ‚Äî here‚Äôs how,Testing high-risk experiments,Thoughtworks,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Thoughtworks Follow ThoughtWorks Featured Insights -- Listen Share By Praful Todkar We have been collaborating with a large US-based fashion retailer to improve their supply chain efficiency. One of the key factors that help solve supply chain puzzles is making sure online orders are fulfilled from the most profitable location ‚Äî a warehouse or a store that maximizes the profit margin on the order. This is the responsibility of the Order Routing algorithm. To identify the most profitable fulfillment location, the Order Routing algorithm uses a variety of ‚Äòlevers‚Äô such as the shipping address, shipping service (example, Expedited vs Regular shipping), inventory, among others. The client‚Äôs Order Routing team wanted to improve their algorithm by leveraging demand forecast and further optimize for gross margin per online order. The principle here is that demand forecast pinpoints the most ‚Äòdisadvantaged‚Äô location ‚Äî a location where the product is likely to go on markdown (a 50% off sale) in the near future. Therefore, margin on the online order can be improved by fulfilling the product from such a disadvantaged location. Let‚Äôs dig into this a little with an example. It‚Äôs fall season and the retailer has received an online order for a pair of shorts. There are two stores that stock the product. One, based out of Chicago and other in San Diego. Our demand forecast tells us that the approaching winter in Chicago will ensure less demand for the product, which means the shorts will go on markdown. As opposed to this, in sunny San Diego the product will sell full price. The order should be fulfilled from Chicago, the disadvantaged location, to yield a better margin. The Order Routing algorithm is a ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô algorithm and small changes to it can have a big impact on the margin of fulfilled orders. One example could be; accounting for higher shipping costs of one location over another. This is why prototyping is a preferred path when evolving the algorithm. The project team‚Äôs new demand forecast approach went through the prototype stage as well but, with certain limitations. The prototype could not be built for the entire data set due to sheer volume which meant inaccurate results. There was also no real-time feedback from the changes planned for the production software, as the prototype was disconnected from the production systems. We needed to find a better solution! Our client partnered with ThoughtWorks not just for our software development expertise but also to inculcate the culture and capabilities of Lean Thinking (test-and-learn). And, given the algorithm‚Äôs sensitivity, a real time feedback loop for software changes was essential. While a solution was identified based on prototype results, it did not guarantee a lot of confidence. In response, the team built a test-and-learn platform that pitted multiple solutions against one another, and used business metrics to determine the best solution. While test-and-learn is a commonly used technique to test variations of user interfaces, this situation was unique because we were testing business logic. Moreover, it had to be carried out on an enterprise backend, low latency system within a complex business domain and a high risk environment. Getting this right was paramount and called for a well thought out architecture that would support the business need. Let‚Äôs get into a little more details of the kind of architecture we were working with. A test-and-learn platform conventionally has 3 components: The algorithm in production is called the ‚Äòactive‚Äô algorithm. The new solutions are implemented as experiment algorithms in ‚Äòpassive‚Äô mode ‚Äî running in isolation without affecting the active algorithm. This safety feature was instrumental in getting us the green light to build the platform. The active algorithm‚Äôs input parameters are passed on to the experiment algorithms, along with the necessary transient data. This helps with an ‚Äòapples-to-apples‚Äô comparison. The analytics framework compares the experiment algorithms‚Äô output with the active algorithm‚Äôs output using complex business calculations (gross margin lift). The winning experiment algorithm is promoted to production, making it active ‚Äî merging it with the active algorithm or running it alongside the active algorithm. The aforementioned business impact dashboard monitors the newly promoted experiment algorithms‚Äô impact, on the health metrics. These metrics are the Order Routing‚Äôs Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Although the test-and-learn platform has been a great success, the project team did overcome their fair share of challenges to meet this success. Running the experiments in passive mode was the perfect way to avoid negative fallout from the experiments on the Order Routing algorithm. Business users try new improvements without worrying about consequences. Additionally, business could turn off a newly promoted experiment after reading the business impact dashboard, and immediately have orders routed through the earlier, safe version of the algorithm. Quick feedback is the lifeblood of experimentation, and the team built a low-fi implementation for the dependency; demand forecast. The team imported a small subset of real data into the application database and manually refreshed it at regular intervals. This low-fi implementation meant the team could launch the experiment in just a few weeks instead of a few months, and receive valuable feedback from production. The low-fi and hi-fi implementation shared a common interface which resulted in minimal change (and a lot less throw away work) when migrating to the hi-fi implementation. The real data used in the Low-Fi version was periodically refreshed from the external dependency. This was a temporary hassle but it helped uncover a lot of issues early on ‚Äî not only in the algorithm but also in the data from the dependency. For example, of different demand forecast variants, we requested the appropriate variant based on initial learnings. This helped us to influence the development of the external dependency as well. Conventionally, web based A/B test results can be analyzed relatively quickly. However, in our case, the algorithm‚Äôs effectiveness, measured in gross margin lift, could only be carried out after 6‚Äì12 weeks. In response to this longer loop, the project team came up with the ‚Äúfeedback confidence levels‚Äù concept. A quick but low confidence level was used to make small tweaks to the algorithm, while the highest confidence level (that took longer) was used to determine eligibility for promotion to production. The business impact dashboard‚Äôs KPIs needed to have a direct cause and effect relationship with the code being changed, while also staying aligned to the organization‚Äôs KPIs. For example, shipping costs is an organizational KPI. But this metric could be affected by multiple organizational initiatives that sometimes even run contrary to each other. To avoid system ‚Äònoise‚Äô, the project team picked a metric that was only affected by our system while giving us a directional read on the organizational KPI. One such metric was ‚Äòpercentage of shipments from stores versus warehouses‚Äô. The code in our system directly impacted that percentage. As a general rule of thumb, shipments from warehouses are cheaper than stores and hence if the percentage of shipments skewed largely in favor of stores after a certain experiment went live, it would increase shipping costs, thus negatively affecting the organization‚Äôs ‚Äòshipping cost‚Äô KPI. The metrics were identified by the same team developing the experiment which meant they would be prioritized as per the project‚Äôs needs. It was also encouraging to witness the team‚Äôs emotional investment in the success of the experiment since the metric was real time validation not only of the experiment but also the hard work put in. One of the unintended but pleasant consequences of having a business impact dashboard was relooking at existing business inefficiencies and identifying new opportunities. For example, store shipments would skew from normal to becoming excessively high during certain business hours. The test-and-learn platform created highly specialized algorithms for certain types of orders, like expedited orders, which have incidentally been a huge upgrade for the product. It has been a game-changing experience to solve business problems with creative solutioning and validating the right solution through rapid experimentation. In our particular scenario, during the test phase, we averaged a +2% in gross margin per single SKU transaction. This effectively meant that with the new test-and-learn platform, there had been a drastic reduction in cost of validating business hypotheses. And, the project team had gone on to enhance the Order Routing product, and consequently the architecture, to support experimentation and analytics as first-class concepts.

By acquainting themselves to those key characteristics, CIOs will hack into the implementation of cloud computing with ease. AWS was the pioneer within the full application of cloud computing as an alternative to on-premises infrastructure in 2006. Today, the cloud computing technology covers IaaS to SaaS and every one the services enclosed in between, such as AI, containers, serverless systems, databases, IoT, dedicated networking, analytics, business apps, and lots of others.

These square measure the seven key characteristics of cloud computing the CIOs ought to understand before customizing, deploying, and building the cloud into the most recent application of the company: The majority of the public cloud platforms provide resources to the users at the click of a button or through an API call. These vendors possess massive amounts of compute and storage assets on standby for immediate use, distributed among data centers all over the world. This not only monitors efficiency but also presents somewhat radical changes among the CIOs and their teams who are accustomed to long waiting periods for completion. 2.

https://medium.com/@TantraLabs/holiday-gift-guide-bitcoin-edition-a22e37ca0221?source=tag_archive---------21-----------------------,Holiday Gift Guide: Bitcoin Edition,Published in Tantra Labs,Tantra Labs,No Author URL,N/A,13 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tantra Labs Follow Tantra Labs -- 1 Listen Share The holiday season is a time for gathering with friends and family, but most importantly, it‚Äôs a great time to shill Bitcoin TO your friends and family! At Tantra Labs we love the holidays. The day after Halloween someone in the office lit a gingerbread-scented candle, and we‚Äôve been counting down the days until our office holiday party ever since... Every day though, it seems like a new list of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù holiday gifts pops up on the web, and while I will definitely be writing to Santa to ask for the new noise-cancelling airpods‚Ä¶ we thought it would be fun to come up with a list of gifts for all the bitcoiners, newcoiners, and precoiners in your lives. After polling the team at Tantra, here‚Äôs what we came up with: No surprise here! But how do you gift bitcoin to friends and family who are new to bitcoin or, how do we put this lightly.. friends and family who aren‚Äôt the most tech savvy? Our favorite method is with GiveBitcoin. With GiveBitcoin you can gift BTC to friends and family without having to worry about them losing it. That‚Äôs because GiveBitcoin time locks the BTC for at least a year (you can choose a longer time frame), and they will send your recipients a curated curriculum of educational resources from experts like Saifedean Ammous & Yan Pritzker, so your friends and family can learn not only why Bitcoin is important, but also how to safely secure it on their own when the timelock is up. Check them out. We are BIG fans. P.S. You can gift yourself Bitcoin too! So this category isn‚Äôt really about the person receiving gifts‚Ä¶ its about you! If you‚Äôre going to be buying gifts anyway, you should definitely take advantage of these awesome platforms and stack some sats: FoldApp.com ‚Äì Fold is an amazing platform and iOS & Android app that allows you to buy gift cards for major retailers like Amazon, Starbucks, Best Buy, and REI. You can pay using a credit/debit card, but if you pay in BTC using the Lightning Network, you get a much higher Sats Back reward. For advanced Bitcoin users, you can use SparkSwap to instantly convert the boomer bucks in your bank account to Lightning BTC. Using Fold also helps protect your privacy by shielding your transactions from retailers. Hell yeahü§ò And lastly.. Fold will be rolling out the ‚ÄúSend as a Gift‚Äù feature very soon, right in time for the Holidays. That means you can purchase a gift card, stack some sats, and Fold will send the gift cards to whoever you like. P.S. Use my code ‚ÄúO96Fvmsv‚Äù when you sign up and we both get 20,000 sweet, sweet sats! Lolli.com ‚Äì Lolli is another amazing way to earn sats on purchases you‚Äôre already going to be making. With hundreds of online retailers to choose from, you‚Äôd be doing yourself a disservice if you don‚Äôt check Lolli for holiday gifts before you make your purchases. Want to know what their best deals are? Check out their Ultimate Holiday Sats Back Gift Guide. Coldcard Wallet - Hands down the best hardware wallet for Bitcoiners. It isn‚Äôt as easy to use as a Ledger or Trezor, but if you‚Äôre a real Bitcoiner, the Coldcard is a must. Frankly it really isn‚Äôt that difficult to use, and you‚Äôll REALLY feel like a cypherpunk when you set it up. Our friends at Tales from the Crypt have a great video guide as well in case you need some extra hand-hodling. Casa Node 2 - With a sleek new redesign, the Casa Node 2 (part of every paid Casa membership) gives you everything you need to get started with running your own Bitcoin + Lightning node and multi-sig. ‚ÄúEverything you need to use, secure, and support Bitcoin in one easy package.‚Äù And when they say easy, they mean it. Their UI/UX is unparalleled. The Nodl One & Nodl Dojo - Sorry Casa, but in our opinion the Nodl nodes are a wee bit sexier than the Casa. But with more power and more memory, they‚Äôre also more expensive... These nodes are definitely for more advanced Bitcoin users, but they‚Äôre well worth it. For a longer lasting node, go for the Nodl Dojo, which comes with dual SSDs in a RAID configuration for backups & storage. Also it‚Äôs red. That means it‚Äôs faster. myNode One+ - In between the ‚Äúnode-in-a-box‚Äù options above and the ‚Äúbuild-your-own-node‚Äù below, is this nifty option from myNode. It includes the myNode Premium Software, Rock64 device, an aluminum case, power supply, SD Card, and 1TB hard drive. Check it out folks. Raspberry Pi 4 - Have a Bitcoiner in your family who‚Äôs been looking to build their own node from scratch? The Raspberry Pi 4 is the way to go. It‚Äôs actually what powers the new Casa node, and you can use it for all sorts of fun coding projects. Hook them up with the Raspberry Pi 4 CanaKit and they‚Äôll have almost everything they need to get started. Note that you should probably buy your soon-to-be node operator an external hard drive as well so he or she can download the full Bitcoin blockchain. And in terms of how to set up the node, we recommend the Raspibolt guide from Stadicus. GoTenna Mesh - Off-grid bitcoin transactions? Yes please! GoTenna‚Äôs mesh devices are a really unique gift. You can use them to send bitcoin transactions from off-the-grid, but they‚Äôre also fantastic for emergency situations, hiking, music festivals, or any other situation where internet and cell-service are spotty or just plain lacking. Lightnite ‚Äî This game is going to be so cool! Yes it‚Äôs a Fortnite clone, but it promises to be so much more than that. Play in ‚ÄúBitcoin-mode‚Äù and steal sats from your friends! There‚Äôll also be limited edition in-game items that you can steal from the enemies you‚Äôve vanquished in glorious low-poly battle! The game isn‚Äôt out yet, but you can preorder it now and be one of the first to play. CoinmineOne - You may not make a lot of money using this, (or you might!) and in some places where the cost of electricity is high, it may not be profitable to run it at all, but that being said, the CoinmineOne IS pretty damn SEXY and it‚Äôs a great conversation starter. We have one mining in our office, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt fun to open up the Coinmine App and watch the satoshi balance get higher and higher. Check it out if you‚Äôve got some extra boomer bucks to burn. And make sure you‚Äôre mining for bitcoins not shitcoins... Fun fact, when you mine for ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù with the CoinmineOne it‚Äôs mining for shitcoins and auto-converting them to bitcoin for you, but this is actually good for Bitcoin as it creates sell pressure for those shitcoins. BitPiggys - For young and old alike, who wouldn‚Äôt want a cute little piggy bank tied to an Opendime? Perfect as a functional desk ornament for the bitcoiners in your lives or as a tool to teach anyone about bitcoin and saving. Bitcoin Money: A Tale of Bitville - Written by Michael ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Rabbi‚Äù Caras, this illustrated children‚Äôs book is truly a joy to read. And it‚Äôs not just for kids. Without getting too technical, this book explores what money is and how Bitcoin really is better money. Get a discount when you order a 10-pack or a 30-pack, and drop these in your neighbors‚Äô mailboxes with a note from Santa Claus (or Hanukkah Harry!). We won‚Äôt tell on you.. Cryptosteel Capsule - This is one of the cooler private key storage solutions to come out of late. I‚Äôm personally not a huge fan of the tiled options out there, and I really love the aesthetics of the capsule. Their website states: ‚ÄúOur solution combines the age-old idea of engraving ‚Äî in a DIY assembly format ‚Äî with material that is stainless, shockproof, acid-resistant and fireproof up to 1400C/2500F. It is compatible with most secret sharing and key generation algorithms, and keeps the enclosed data secure. Even in cases of aggressive acts such as theft, bribery, vandalism or violence your master secret can remain safe forever.‚Äù Cryptotag Thor - Definitely one of the more expensive options, especially if you go with the Thor model that includes a hammer. But like come on, that‚Äôs a pretty rad hammer, and if you carry it with you maybe it can help fend off those $5 wrench attacks‚Ä¶ Regardless of the high price tag, you definitely get what you pay for here. This solution scored all A‚Äôs in Jameson Lopp‚Äôs latest metal bitcoin seed stress test. Crypto Key Stack - I‚Äôm a big fan of this option as well. As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm really NOT a fan of tiled options. They‚Äôre just a bit clunky in my opinion. Now granted, this option requires you to have good handwriting, but I like the ability to stack multiple private keys. That may not be the best thing to do for opsec reasons, but everyone‚Äôs threat models are different. And good to note, this option also scored top marks on Jameson Lopp‚Äôs earlier stress test. The Internet of Money (Volumes 1, 2 AND 3) - Part of the Bitcoin literature canon, this series from Andreas Antonopoulos compiles the best of his many talks, and no Bitcoin bookshelf is complete without them. And Volume 3 comes out on December 15th, right in time for Christmas. Pre-order it on Amazon today. The Bitcoin Standard - What is money? Why is our current system so screwed up? And how does Bitcoin fit into all of this? The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous is one of the most popular books on Bitcoin and Austrian Economics, and for very good reason. It‚Äôs a fantastic primer on the history of money and how the current financial system came about. If you haven‚Äôt read this book yet‚Ä¶ can you really call yourself a bitcoiner? And for those who already have a copy or two on their shelves, another great gift to consider is Saifedean‚Äôs The Bitcoin Standard Academy, a series of very affordable online courses on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. Inventing Bitcoin - Yan Pritzker really hit it out of the park with this book. It‚Äôs short, only 111 pages, and it explains the underlying technology of Bitcoin in a way that is accessible to just about everyone. You may have to read it once or twice if you‚Äôre completely new to Bitcoin, but it‚Äôll be enjoyable every time. The Little Bitcoin Book - Written by some of the top names in the Bitcoin and human rights spaces, including Alena Vranova, Jimmy Song, and Alex Gladstein (and others!), this pocket sized book takes a more human approach to understanding the importance and potential of Bitcoin. Definitely a good gift for those folks who are new to Bitcoin or less tech savvy than most. Bitcoin Billionaires - From Ben Mezrich, the author of Bringing down the House and The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, Bitcoin Billionaires is a fantastic read that gives you a unique glimpse into the early days of Bitcoin. Step into the shoes of Charlie Shrem and Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss. Learn about the early days of Bitinstant and experience Mark Zuckerburg‚Äôs treachery from the Winkelvoss‚Äô point of view. To be perfectly honest, The Social Network gave me a bad impression of the twins, but after reading Billionaires, I gained a newfound respect for them and their role in Bitcoin history. Highly recommend this book for bitcoiners & precoiners alike. LuchoPoletti.com - When it comes to Bitcoin propaganda art, Lucho Poletti really knows what he‚Äôs doing. Inspired by street artists like Shepard Fairey, Lucho sells an amazing array of artwork and apparel designed to make you rethink the world around you and look to Bitcoin for hope. Opendimes - From the same folks who make the Coldcard Wallet, get yourself some Opendimes immediately! They look like little USB drives, but they say ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù on them. What are they? Basically they are a way to store bitcoin and make offline transactions. You can load up an Opendime with some bitcoin using the public key, but the private key won‚Äôt be revealed until you poke a needle through a small hole on the back, popping out part of the hardware. It‚Äôs basically a bearer instrument for bitcoin. And the best part is they‚Äôre cheap and fit perfectly into your stockings. Also they have curved edges so they also fit nicely into ‚Äúnature‚Äôs stocking.‚Äù Bitcoin and Friends - What do you mean you haven‚Äôt watched Bitcoin and Friends yet?! Go to YouTube and binge all the episodes immediately, and then check out their merch shop here. All sorts of fun stocking stuffers to proudly rep Bitcoin and Friends. Rock on little man! You‚Äôll find your dad one day! 21X (formerly Bitcoin Outlet) - From the folks over at Bull Bitcoin, 21X puts out some of the coolest, limited edition Bitcoiner apparel out there. But be warned, they only accept Bitcoin. Don‚Äôt trust me though, check out their site and verify for yourself just how badass their merch is. Tales from the Crypt - ‚ÄúSup freaks?‚Äù Tales from the Crypt is one of the best Bitcoin podcasts out there. If you or your friends and family are fans of TFTC, why not support the pod by purchasing some quality merch? Bkawww! LayerOneBTC - Definitely one of our favorite Bitcoin merch sites. They put out so many clever t-shirts, you‚Äôll have trouble not buying all of them. From their ‚ÄúRunning Bitcoin‚Äù T, to their ‚ÄúCraig Wright is a Fraud‚Äù T‚Ä¶ LayerOneBTC has got you covered. Excellion.com - According to Samson Mow, ‚ÄúA hat is the first step on the path to self-discovery.‚Äù The exploration of the philosophical underpinnings of that idea deserves its own Medium article. So we won‚Äôt go any deeper than that just now. Either way, you can‚Äôt go wrong with this TOXIC hat. It glows in the dark and is guaranteed to make at least 21% of Twitter hate you. But only because deep down inside they know you‚Äôre right. VonBitcoin.com ‚Äî Last, but certainly not least‚Ä¶ a shameless plug for my own e-commerce site! I sell tons of Bitcoin-only apparel and gifts, including t-shirts, art prints, Bitcoin & Lightning ‚Äúnot‚Äù pop-sockets, and if you‚Äôre looking for something very special, contact me here for one-of-a-kind Bitcoin artwork. Thank you all for reading and we hope you found this holiday guide fun and helpful. From myself and the rest of the Tantra team, we wish you a very happy hodlday season!

Today (that‚Äôs 1st Jan) marks the official launch of QuuBe, Asia‚Äôs first online marketplace built on the blockchain. Launch festivities will last through the whole month of January, so download the app today (iOS / Android) to stay in touch with the latest promotions. Read on for more details! But first, for those who aren‚Äôt familiar, what is blockchain? In short, ‚Äúit is a digital ledger technology that creates permanent and unchangeable records‚Äù. This new form of accounting uses advanced forms of information distribution and consensus mechanisms. In other words, that means that 1) it is virtually impossible to change or delete recorded transactions, and 2) multiple verifications are made to confirm that the transaction is valid and legit. Check out this video for a more detailed explanation on the basics of blockchain technology. With that out of the way, we get to what QuuBe is: an online marketplace built with blockchain as its core. What does that mean for users, and why should you check it out? Buyers and sellers on QuuBe will transact via the platform‚Äôs own token, the Q*coin. Built on the Ethereum blockchain standard, your Q*coins are stored in a digital wallet built into the QuuBe app, and can only be accessed by you. Literally. You‚Äôll see that our set up process recommends for you to back up your Q*coin wallet password, because if you lose that password, it will be pretty much impossible for our support colleagues to unlock the wallet for you. It‚Äôs that secure. The Q*coin is also pegged to the value of the US Dollar, which ensures that a stable value is maintained, and makes an easy point of reference. Right now, the conversion rate for 1 Q*coin is 1 USD, with plans to appreciate the token‚Äôs value by increasing the conversion rate, as more Q*coins go into circulation. As a buyer, you can purchase Q*coins with no extra conversion fees, although prevailing currency exchange rates will apply. For the month of January, you will also enjoy a 10% introductory discount with every 100 Q*coins purchased (ie. you only pay 90 USD)! As a seller on the QuuBe platform, you will be able to list your items and sell them for no platform or service costs at all. You will also get to convert your earned Q*coins back to currency for no additional fees. How are all of these cost removals possible? The amount of administrative manpower required on conventional e-commerce websites, including Qoo10, means that charging platform fees and sales commissions are unavoidable if the business intends to survive in the longer term. A blockchain-based platform, on the other hand, is able to utilise smart contracts to digitally manage many of these administrations. Think of a smart contract as a will or rule book that automatically governs and executes a certain set of transactions and processes. Putting this automation in place greatly reduces the administrative manpower required, and consequently, its associated costs. QuuBe is open and ready to welcome you today!

I‚Äôm not speaking of the little interruptions that occur when you lose focus on a task. I‚Äôm speaking of the mindless tasks you complete every day without even recognizing for a moment what it is you‚Äôre doing. You scurry down the street toward your job focused on your phone, your email, or on all the things you‚Äôre going to say or do during the day. You don‚Äôt see the other people sharing the sidewalk with you; you fail to notice whether the sun is out or not; and you definitely have no idea of where you are or where you‚Äôre going. It‚Äôs all instinct and habit. But what if you let go of all the distractions and simply focused on the moment. What if you looked at your surroundings and actually took notice of the day? How much more interesting your day might be if you actually participated in it rather than drifted along, going from distraction to distraction? While going for a walk the other day, I actually took that advice. I put myself into the moment and was amazed at all the things I had been missing up to then. There was a hint of pink just lining the edge of the horizon. A deer raised its head and gazed stoically at me before resuming its grazing of the neighbor‚Äôs garden. A squirrel chittered overhead, unseen and hidden in the canopy of one of the nearby trees, and one of the neighbor‚Äôs cats slunk under the car, its green eyes following me as I strolled past. I wondered how often these creatures had been out there watching me as I marched through the numerous mornings ignoring everything around me while texting, tweeting, or checking my email. When at work, I often find myself disengaged because I‚Äôm too busy doing everything on automatic instead of actually thinking about the tasks I need to accomplish and what they entail. So many evenings I would get home and think, ‚ÄúI need a new job, this one is just so boring.‚Äù It seemed that my days were mechanical ‚Äî go in do the tasks, go home. Never anything different; never a change. But you know what? Sometimes, you don‚Äôt need a new job, you just need a new attitude, a new perspective. You may do your job out of habit right now, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you need a new job. If you actually look at each task and treat it as something new and unique, instead of just the same as yesterday‚Äôs tasks, you‚Äôll find yourself not only engaged, but perhaps even enjoying the days and the job a lot more. In today‚Äôs world, it is so easy to become distracted. We have cell phones that do everything from letting you watch television shows and movies, read books, text, tweet, and‚Ä¶oh yeah, even make and receive phone calls. We have cars that let us send and receive phone calls, texts, and watch movies; we have watches that link us to social media; and we have computers that keep us linked in, hooked up, and completely distracted wherever and whenever we want. And if all that technology fails to keep us distracted, we can do an excellent job of distracting ourselves by worrying about the past or the future instead of focusing on the here and now. So, unplug, disconnect, and stop worrying about what was and what might be, and simply focus on the what and when of now. Notice the people around you, listen to the sounds around you, and involve yourself with the events happening right now. It‚Äôs amazing how energized you‚Äôll feel when you do. -- -- TA Sullivan was born in the back of a cab and has continued to be unconventional in all that she does.

A similar dynamic is at work today, where entrepreneurs and small and medium-size enterprises can‚Äôt tap the latest technology because of cost. Larger companies all around the world are remaking themselves in a digital transformation, and the technology that enables this should be made available to their junior partners as well. This is critical for today‚Äôs worldwide supply chains, which, along with globalization and e-commerce, have emerged as one of the most core and critical competencies in the modern world. A global supply chain now spans the planet, with suppliers that produce needed parts, components and subassemblies providing them to product manufacturers for assembly into their finished goods. These larger manufacturers have invested heavily in digital transformation ‚Äî like digital simulation, to prove things out beforehand by modeling a digital replica ‚Äî and enterprise-wide digital makeovers are sweeping across industry after industry globally. Yet many organizations in their supply chains lack the resources to become full partners in these digital ecosystems. I chose the word ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù to suggest that all participants in an industrial supply chain should have ‚Äúequal‚Äù access to this important technology. This access would bring benefits not only to the supply chain member but also to the larger manufacturer, as the small firms would now have the tools to innovate performance and cost gains in their particular corners of the supply chain. Right now, the benefits to the haves greatly disadvantage the have-nots. Using tools like digital simulation, the haves are able to explore the possibilities of a wide variety of manufacturing materials and processes without having to develop the real manufacturing system. This means that more alternatives can be considered ‚Äî and more risk reduced ‚Äî before the decisions are made to invest in the physical assets necessary to execute an optimal manufacturing strategy. Small and medium-size businesses have been the have-nots, relying on the trial-and-error methods of the past ‚Äî because the requisite investments in new simulation platforms, and supporting personnel fluent in the digital enterprise, are substantial, and beyond their means. Purdue University is tackling this problem with a ‚Äúvirtual factory hub,‚Äù which will make advanced modeling and simulation tools available via a simple web browser and cloud services platform. This browser-based system with cloud computing will put the power of digital tools into the hands of engineers at smaller and medium-size companies ‚Äî no matter their location or computer assets ‚Äî so they can simulate different manufacturing strategies to predict how each will perform in actual use, in such industries as automotive, aerospace, and clean energy. Our Composites Virtual Factory Hub at the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) is investigating browser- and cloud-based delivery of ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù ‚Äî simulated, digital duplicates of manufacturing processes like additive manufacturing (3D printing), molding, and forming, which have been tailored for these high-tech combinatorial materials. Others are trying something similar in different sectors ‚Äî for example, nanoHUB.org hosts simulation tools for nanoscale technology research, education and collaboration. One of the biggest issues in business today is how to bring supply chain members into the larger digital enterprise, to close the loop on the complete digital transformation that is required for modernization and competitiveness. The democratization of innovative technologies like digital simulation will be a giant step forward toward achieving that aim. by R. Byron Pipes, John L.

Vermeulen, PhD",No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Erik P.M. Vermeulen, PhD Follow HackerNoon.com -- 2 Listen Share More and more articles, blogs and videos predict the end of Apple is near. I even read a story comparing Apple to Nokia. And, we all now, that does not end well. But all of these articles are missing an important point. They tend to look at Apple products in isolation: ‚ÄúiPhone sales go down‚Äù or the ‚ÄúThe iMac loses its magic.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs most successful decision, however, was its move from ‚Äúbeing a tech company‚Äù to ‚Äúbeing an ecosystem.‚Äù And ecosystems are extremely resilient and able to survive even the most dramatic change in the environment. That is why I believe that the Apple ecosystem remains strong and will continue to play a key role in the future of tech, work and society. We can all still learn from Apple. I am writing this piece after I evaluated and assessed several startup investment proposals. The business plans focused on health, healthcare, and well-being. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how emerging technologies are radically changing industries. For instance, blockchain startups propose solutions for the many inefficiencies, errors, and bureaucracy in the current healthcare systems. Think about improving the accessibility of patient records and tracking the production and distribution of drugs and medicines. Other startups use ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù to improve medical diagnoses. The innovations in robot-assisted surgery are mind-blowing. But most of the proposals see the future of healthcare in ‚Äúplatforms.‚Äù The ‚Äúplatform idea‚Äù makes sense. The population is aging, and with it, we see an increase in elderly diseases and health complications. There is a need for technologies that create value by facilitating and coordinating smooth and direct connections between two or more groups of users. Think patients, caregivers, medical professionals, etc. The platforms also allow alerts to be created and data to be collected and analyzed for medical and health applications. Most of the startup companies I see focus their proposals on the technology of the platforms. They explain why their algorithm, data, sensors are superior to the technology used by their competitors. But the best startups don‚Äôt sell a platform. They recognize the benefits of building one or more ecosystems. According to Wikipedia, an ecosystem is ‚Äúa community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system.‚Äù Having assessed the business plans, I can roughly distinguish between two ecosystems: (1) the Netflix ecosystem and (2) the Apple Ecosystem. The Netflix ecosystem uses a ‚Äúmicroservices‚Äù architecture to accelerate growth, be adaptable to change, and give more value to the end-users of the services. Think of these ecosystems as a collection of loosely coupled applications which are configured to interact through application programming interfaces (APIs). The API approach provides flexibility and windows to new and other ecosystems. It also allows the ecosystem to attract innovative ideas from third-party developers. medium.com Apple is another prominently used and well-known example of an ecosystem. I am a fervent Apple user and can subscribe to the advantages of a ‚Äútechnology ecosystem‚Äù of connected, interoperable, and seamlessly interacting products/devices (iMac, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods). In the proposed healthcare ecosystems that I have reviewed, we can distinguish between two other important components: (1) the content (connecting, monitoring, analyzing, predicting) and (2) the community or communities of caregivers, patients, etc. What usually strikes me is that the ecosystem proposals tend to become repetitive very quickly. Having explained the technology, content, and potential communities, the proposals often include more illustrations, explanations of the same. This is surprising as both the Netflix and the Apple example show that there are (at least) three other components essential in the creation of a thriving and attractive ecosystem. The first missing component is leadership. During Macworld 1997 in Boston (Steve Jobs having just returned to Apple), the focus wasn‚Äôt on the technology and content. A change in leadership was necessary to build the Apple ecosystem: ‚ÄúSo, what are some beginning steps that we are gonna take? One of the first ones has to be to start at the top. Apple‚Äôs done a lot of change at the bottom and I think this change needs to start at the top, with the board of directors focusing on relevance.‚Äù Leadership is about mission, vision, and creativity. The ‚Äúleadership‚Äù has to identify and then ‚Äúlive by‚Äù a set of core values in all its decisions and operations. In late 1997, Apple adopted the slogan ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù to re-launch the brand, go back to basics and focus on ‚Äúwhat really matters.‚Äù Most of the business plans that I have reviewed don‚Äôt address leadership (including the role of advisors) or only mention it in passing. The second missing (and related) component is the culture (of the ecosystem). We all know that a strong culture can lead to greater loyalty and a sense of community that attracts and helps retain talent, third-party developers, users, etc. A strong culture ensures that the ecosystem is unified and its stakeholders working together to achieve a common goal. What is a strong culture? Of course, the Netflix culture springs to mind where the company‚Äôs core values determine who gets ‚Äúhired and fired.‚Äù Also, an ecosystem needs to offer an accessible, honest, and experience to stakeholders. Remember that if an ecosystem fails to behave in a responsible manner ‚Äî in terms of how it handles privacy data, service providers or any platform stakeholder ‚Äî then users will quickly migrate to an alternative ecosystem. As a result ‚Äî given the dependence on the network effects that come from retaining users ‚Äî that ecosystem will risk severe damage or even collapse. Also, ecosystems must facilitate connections to a community of users that ‚Äúmatters‚Äù to them. They must ‚Äúinvite‚Äù genuine user creativity and engagement. Apple communicated with the market through its popular and famous keynotes. The hype that Apple used to build up in anticipation of their events has proven to be an effective means of feeding excitement and interest in its ecosystem. qz.com Today social media and social media platforms play a crucial role. Yet, too many startup companies (particularly when they are university spin-outs) rely on scientific papers and other academic output to create new markets, generate interest, and build communities. They don‚Äôt realize that in the modern digital social and mobile world, every company is now in the media business. To be successful, however, an ecosystem needs to gather feedback from the community and ensure that the interests and concerns of users get regularly integrated into its services and operations. And, smart use of social media is doing just that. Building ecosystems require innovative partners. In 1997, Steve Jobs framed it as follows: ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôd like to talk about meaningful partners. Apple lives in an ecosystem. And it means help from other partners; it means to help other partners.‚Äù This statement is still relevant today. Partnering-for-innovation involves re-thinking the external boundaries of the ecosystem to include actors that can have a crucial bearing on decisions and actions. Key partners now include research centers, universities, and other companies. Traditionally, these partners have been conceptualized as being on the outside, or peripheral to an organization, but the need for inclusive partnering means that such metaphors are no longer appropriate. The recent announcement of Apple‚Äôs partnership with the global investment bank Goldman Sachs shows the relevance of partnerships today. For Apple, it opens the door to enter the financial ecosystem or bring financial services to its existing ecosystem. qz.com The last example reveals an important point; that ecosystems evolve. Apple is an excellent illustration of this. In 1997, leadership, culture, and partnerships were important drivers behind Apple‚Äôs initial success. Over the years, the crucial role was taken over by technology, content, and community. Leadership, culture, and partnership weren‚Äôt neglected but were of minor importance. For instance, the Apple Keynote generates far less excitement than five years ago. But this is about to change. With more and more users‚Äô migrating to other ecosystems (at least in my environment), it is only to be expected that Apple will put more emphasis on Leadership and Culture in the future. The new partnership with Goldman Sachs and the offering of new financial services are just one of the signs of the transitions in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. And this is the final thing that is missing in most of the startup proposals. Companies, platforms, and ecosystems now operate in hyper-competitive global markets against a background of exponential technological growth, fast-moving business developments and continuously evolving consumer demands. This new operating environment creates constant pressure on ecosystems. Simple ‚Äútweaks‚Äù to existing services is not going to be enough to survive in the medium-to-long term. Indeed, if we look at any of the major ecosystems, we can see a constant expansion in technology, content, communities, leadership, culture, and partnerships. And it is the resilience of a strong ecosystem ‚Äî the capacity to adapt to even the most threatening transformation in the environment ‚Äî that may be the most significant lesson to be learnt from Apple and their whole approach to organizing and operating a business.

https://medium.com/@EXPERTinCRM/the-future-landscape-of-fintech-e0a9175b593a?source=tag_archive---------185-----------------------,The Future Landscape of Fintech,Written by Rolustech,Rolustech,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rolustech Follow -- Listen Share The world is evolving at an unprecedented pace and at the heart of this evolution is the practical use of scientific knowledge: Technology. Technology is all around us, embedded into our everyday activities, and shows no signs of stopping as we head towards the end of decade. The world has fully embraced the advent of simplicity and personalization brought to us by technology and have started to explore its applications in various different industries. This leads us to our topic for today; Fintech. Financial Technology is everything that aims to streamline your financial needs and requirements, and with the surge in popularity of AI and Machine Learning, Fintech enthusiasts have found new avenues to explore. Fintech is changing the finance industry for customers in ways that were unimaginable five years ago; and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be a far stretch to say you probably wouldn‚Äôt need to visit a bank five years from today. Thanks to Fintech, you can make transactions online without having to access an ATM. You can use your mobile phone as a wallet and use it to buy things on the internet, but as amazing as this may sound, all of this is merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Fintech. Let‚Äôs explore this in a little more detail. As we move towards a world driven by data, AI, and machine learning, we will see how these are leveraged to bring the most out of Fintech. Perhaps we could have financial advisers built on AI that can take care of a consumers financial investments without any human interaction involved? Perhaps machine learning can be used to revolutionize stock market trading? Or consumers can shift to Blockchains and completely change the landscape of finance as we know it? The key takeaway from this discourse is the overarching narrative of simplifying the processes for consumers that have been for long been at the mercy of the financial industry bent on exploiting them. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the ways consumers can leverage Fintech for themselves: As we already mentioned, Fintech has helped consumers buy things online without having to physically make an exchange. Where people once had to go out and buy things with paper, they can now sit in the comfort of their homes and buy things with a click of a button. With Fintech, consumers can buy things across continents without being geographically confined to their vicinity. This has resulted in less market monopoly, more competition, and consequently better products and services across the board. As with all things that concern technology, personalization of products and services based on consumer behavior and actions can be done with the help of Fintech. Fintech helps businesses store data on their customers and consequently helps them target customers with offers that pertain to their interest. GDPR was the hottest topic of 2018 as companies found themselves on the wrong side of regulations and realized data isn‚Äôt free after all. With Data Protection and Privacy regulations in place, companies are forced to explicitly ask for permission before using any customer data or face the courts, as Google recently found when it was sent a $57 million fine by European authorities. Fintech relies on data as we mentioned, and in order to mould the concept around the customer, they need access to this data. Only time will tell how companies work their way around GDPR but as of this moment, how Fintech finds a way around this remains to be seen. Machine learning can be used to find insights in the stock market as well forecast trends in the financial industry. The market applications of Machine Learning are immense but as of this point, its used primarily for predictive analysis. A lot of funding goes into the application of Machine Learning on a broader scale and it remains to be seen how Fintech makes the most of it. Machine Learning can be used to enhance financial security and reduce instances of financial fraud and theft. The present process of a rule based approach is substandard and fails to identify complex issues. With Machine Learning fully integrated in Fintech, instances of fraud can be identified in real-time and counter measures can be taken swiftly to mitigate loss. As good as this sounds, the concept of Fintech is not all rainbows and sunshine. There are a number of ways in which Fintech could potentially be a trickier journey as the world moves to adopt it. Let‚Äôs have a look! The Fintech industry is primarily a niche of startups and entrepreneurs not seasoned in financial ins and outs, and this could pose a problem when Fintech becomes mainstream. The lack of regulations and clarity around Fintech could pose it as a risk for consumers, with data theft and fraud being the least of their worries. Fintech could create a landscape where people not accustomed to smartphones and technology might find themselves excluded from financial benefits and modes of payment. If Fintech succeeds in cementing its place in the market, sooner or later it will be the default mode of transactions and that could leave third-world countries and its residents with an uphill battle. The discourse around Fintech and its pros and cons will continue way beyond its adoption among the masses, but the fact of the matter is that consumers around the world will end up benefiting from it in one way or another.

Allocating attention to other tasks, can lead to our driving performance suffering and putting lives at risk.",OpenLearn,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in OpenLearn Follow -- 1 Listen Share The retired football star David Beckham received a six-month driving ban after being photographed using his hand-held phone while driving. Unfortunately, Beckham is not alone in apparently thinking that time spent driving can also be usefully spent doing something else. But it isn‚Äôt just phones that can distract us while driving. Increasingly, vehicles come pre-installed with technology that promises to improve our lives and let us get that little bit more productivity out of our journey ‚Äî be it digital assistants such as Alexa or parking assist systems. Many such technologies are designed to keep us safe, but could they actually be dangerous ‚Äî giving us a false impression that our attention can be focused elsewhere? We have been finding out. Interestingly, most drivers seem to support the view that hand-held phone use is risky, as it involves the driver potentially taking their hands off the wheel. They also know it is illegal. The problem is that many drivers still continue to use their phones ‚Äúhandsfree‚Äù behind the wheel, because the law allows them to do so providing their hands are on the wheel. This implies it is a safe alternative. www.open.edu But research clearly shows that the driving behaviour and crash risk of a phone-using driver (whether that is hand-held or hands-free) is similar to, and sometimes worse than, that of a drunk driver. Our research has shown that phone use carries a significant cost to a driver‚Äôs attention, making them far more prone to errors, including failures in visual perception and inability to detect and react to hazards. The real problem with phone use is the cognitive demands it places on a driver. If we try to allocate attention to another engaging task at the same time as driving, our performance in both tasks suffers. We are continually introducing more technologies to our vehicles. Drivers can now ask Alexa or Google assistant a question, listen to text messages read aloud by the vehicle and use voice commands to initiate phone calls. All of this tech also works on the assumption that if it‚Äôs only your voice you are using, there are no safety implications. This is problematic as a wealth of research demonstrates that this kind of ‚Äúinfotainment‚Äù technology actually causes some of the distraction that contributes to driver error. The European parliament has announced from 2022, all new cars should be fitted with intelligent speed assistance (ISA), along with other safety features designed to alert drivers to distraction and drowsiness. Driving is complex and fast-paced, requiring the processing of information from multiple inputs, yet often we are made to feel as though it is easy. But demands on attention when driving vary from minute to minute, meaning any focus allocated elsewhere is a precious resource which may not be available when the driver faces an unexpected event. Listening to music, however, is less of a problem as it isn‚Äôt interactive in the same way as other technologies. As failure at the wheel can have devastating consequences, it is unsurprising that the idea of technological solutions to mitigate driver error are also becoming more common. It‚Äôs likely that Beckham‚Äôs Bentley has (at the very least) ABS, parking-assist, reversing sensors and lane-keeping technology. Such technology has led to a trend in advertising that encourages a belief that our modern cars can pretty much drive themselves. The European parliament has announced from 2022, all new cars should be fitted with intelligent speed assistance (ISA), along with other safety features designed to alert drivers to distraction and drowsiness. But will these technologies increase safety, or could they encourage further distraction? Clearly, drivers are not great at respecting speed limits, so it may seem like a good idea to aim to take the choice of whether to speed or not out of our hands. To make something ‚Äútechno-fixable‚Äù though, you need to reduce complex driving behaviour to dichotomies of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù. Technology needs to be told which behaviour triggers which response in simple, binary terms as it cannot (yet) handle ifs and buts and context. But the risk is that this may encourage us to believe that 30mph, for example, is inherently safe, even when 20mph, or even less, might have been the safer choice. This is something we would like to explore further in our research. Likewise, tech that warns a driver if they are showing signs of drowsiness or intoxication, and parks their car for them if they don‚Äôt respond correctly, could actually encourage drivers to think that they can drive when unfit because the car will step in and save them. Technology can be marketed as improving safety, but safety requires understanding ‚Äî not dichotomies. We know that a driver with their hands obligingly at the ‚Äúten and two position‚Äù can nonetheless be dangerously distracted . Yet we are continually introducing technologies to our vehicles that are distracting. Sadly, we can‚Äôt be sure that manufacturers are motivated by selling safety, as opposed to a version of safety that sells. At a time when we are no longer seeing year-on-year reductions in the number of people being killed or seriously injured on our roads, it seems clear that something radical needs to be done to get drivers‚Äô focus back onto the driving task itself ‚Äî and to challenge the perception that getting from A to B is a good opportunity to indulge in catching up on a bit of C.

Getting started in data science can be amazing, especially when you consider the diversity of theories and techniques a data scientist requires to understand in order to do her job completely. Even the term ‚Äúdata science‚Äù can be somewhat vague, and as the domain obtains popularity, it seems to lose representation. To help those new to the field stay on top of industry jargon and terminology, we‚Äôve put together this glossary of data science terms. We hope it will serve as your handy quick reference whenever you‚Äôre working on a project, or reading an article and find you can‚Äôt quite remember what ‚ÄúETL‚Äù means. An algorithm is a set of rules we give a computer so it can take values and manipulate them into a usable form. This can be as easy as telling someone a direction to your apartment or as complex as developing an equation that predicts how the salary of a new employee. Big data is a large amount of data with value. Big data is more about strategies and tools that help computers do complex analysis of very large (read: 1+ TB) data sets. The problems we must address with big data are categorized by the 4 V‚Äôs: volume, variety, veracity, and velocity. Classification deals with categorizing a data point based on its similarity to other data points. It‚Äôs a supervised learning technique. You take a set of data where every item already has a category and look at common traits between each item. You then use those common traits as a guide for what category the new item might have. Regression is another supervised machine learning approach which focuses on how a target value changes as other values within a data set change. Regression problems generally deal with continuous variables, like predicting the next customer that will purchase an item. Clustering techniques typically collect and categorize sets of data points into groups that are ‚Äúsufficiently similar,‚Äù or ‚Äúclose‚Äù to one another. ‚ÄúClose‚Äù varies depending on how you choose to measure distance. Complexity increases as the more features are added to a problem space. Using Supervised learning technique, you give the computer a well-defined set of data. All columns are labeled and the computer can describe what he needs to obtain. It‚Äôs similar to a professor handing you a syllabus and telling you what to expect on the final. Using unsupervised learning technique, the computer builds its own intuition of a set of unlabeled data. unsupervised machine learning finds patterns within data and usually deal with classifying items based on shared traits. It explains the three stages of bringing data from numerous places in a raw form to a screen, ready for analysis. ETL systems are ordinarily gifted to us by data engineers and run behind the scenes. The method of uprooting actionable insight out of a set of data and putting it to good use. This includes everything from cleaning and organizing the data; to analyzing it to find meaningful patterns and connections; to communicating the useful value to stakeholders. This is a process where a Data Scientist will ask basic questions that serve her to understand the context of a data set. whereby a data analyst uses visual exploration tools to understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data, rather than through traditional data management systems. The variance of a set of values measures how spread out those values are. Mathematically, it is the average difference between individual values and the mean for the set of values. The square root of the variance for a set gives us the standard deviation, which is more intuitively useful. Correlation is the measure of how much one set of values depends on another. If values increase together, they are positively correlated. If one values from one set increase as the other decreases, they are negatively correlated. There is no correlation when a change in one set has nothing to do with a change in the other. The art of communicating significant data visually. This includes infographics, traditional plots, or even full data dashboards. This deals with telling fascinating and significant stories with a data-focused approach. It has come about naturally with more information becoming available as data. A story may be about the data or informed by data. There‚Äôs a full handbook if you‚Äôd like to learn more. Similar to data analysis, but more narrowly focused on business metrics. The technical side of BI involves learning how to effectively use software to generate reports and find important trends. It‚Äôs descriptive, rather than predictive. This is involved in the machine learning workflow. When constructing a predictive model, you first offer it a set of training data so it can build understanding, then you pass the model a test set, where it applies its understanding and tries to predict a target value. Overfitting happens when a model considers too much information. It‚Äôs like asking a person to read a sentence while looking at a page through a microscope. The patterns that enable understanding get lost in the noise. Underfitting happens when you don‚Äôt offer a model sufficient information. An example of underfitting would be asking someone to graph the change in temperature over a day and only giving them high and low. Instead of the smooth curve, one might expect, you only have enough information to draw a straight line. Data engineering is all about the back end. These are the people that build systems to make it easy for data scientists to do their analysis. In smaller teams, a data scientist may also be a data engineer. In larger groups, engineers are able to focus solely on speeding up analysis and keeping a data well organized and easy to access. This field is highly focused on using algorithms to gain an edge in the financial sector. These algorithms either recommend or make trading decisions based on a huge amount of data, often on the order of picoseconds. Quantitative analysts are often called ‚Äúquants.‚Äù A calculation that gives us a sense of a ‚Äútypical‚Äù value for a group of numbers. The mean is the sum of a list of values divided by the number of values in that list. It can be deceiving used on its own, and in practice, we use the mean with other statistical values to gain intuition about our data. Summary statistics are the measures we use to communicate insights about our data in a simple way. Examples of summary statistics are the mean, median and standard deviation. A time series is a set of data that are ordered by when each data point happened. Think of stock market prices over the course of a month, or the temperature throughout a day. The residual is a measure of how much a real value differs from some statistical value we calculated based on the set of data. So given a prediction that it will be 20 degrees Fahrenheit at noon tomorrow, when noon hits and its only 18 degrees, we have an error of 2 degrees. This is often used interchangably with the term ‚Äúerror,‚Äù even though, technically, error is a purely theoretical value. The process of taking data in its original form and ‚Äútaming‚Äù it until it works better in a broader workflow or project. Taming means making values consistent with a larger data set, replacing or removing values that might affect analysis or performance later, etc. Wrangling and munging are used interchangeably. The process of taking the knowledge we have as humans and translating it into a quantitative value that a computer can understand. For example, we can translate our visual understanding of the image of a mug into a representation of pixel intensities. The process of identifying what traits of a data set are going to be the most valuable when building a model. It‚Äôs especially helpful with large data sets, as using fewer features will decrease the amount of time and complexity involved in training and testing a model. The process begins with measuring how relevant each feature in a data set is for predicting your target variable. You then choose a subset of features that will lead to a high-performance model. ‚ÄúA number or algebraic symbol prefixed as a multiplier to a variable or unknown quantity (Ex.: x in x(y + z), 6 in 6ab‚Äù[websters] When graphing an equation such as y = 3x + 4, the coefficient of x determines the line‚Äôs slope. Discussions of statistics often mention specific coefficients for specific tasks such as the correlation coefficient, Cramer‚Äôs coefficient, and the Gini coefficient. When using data with a machine learning algorithm, ‚Äúthe name was given to a set of methods that split up the data set into training sets and test sets. The training set is given to the algorithm, along with the correct answers and becomes the set used to make predictions. The algorithm is then asked to make predictions for each item in the test set. The answers it gives are compared to the correct answers, and an overall score for how well the algorithm did is calculated The value of a dependent value(y) ‚Äúdepends‚Äù on the value of the independent variable(y). If you‚Äôre measuring the effect of different sizes of an advertising budget on total sales, then the advertising budget figure is the independent variable and total sales are the dependent variable. Dimension reduction is the means of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.‚ÄúWe can use a technique called principal component analysis to extract one or more dimensions that capture as much of the variation in the data as possible. Dimensionality reduction is mostly useful when your data set has a large number of dimensions and you want to find a small subset that captures most of the variation. ‚ÄúA specification of a mathematical (or probabilistic) relationship that exists between different variables.‚Äù[grus] Because ‚Äúmodeling‚Äù can mean so many things, the term ‚Äústatistical modeling‚Äù is often used to more accurately describe the kind of modeling that data scientists do. The analysis of data to predict future events, typically to aid in business planning. This incorporates predictive modeling and other techniques. Machine learning might be considered a set of algorithms to help implement predictive analytics. The more business-oriented spin of ‚Äúpredictive analytics‚Äù makes it a popular buzz phrase in marketing literature. -- -- 100 Days of Data Science code challenge Data Science, Machine Learning and Software Engineering Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*BT3CnlK60mv-mH_-AKUGUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*lj9nhPL1mQkrbQO4Rx0YCQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*BT3CnlK60mv-mH_-AKUGUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*BT3CnlK60mv-mH_-AKUGUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*BT3CnlK60mv-mH_-AKUGUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*lj9nhPL1mQkrbQO4Rx0YCQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*lj9nhPL1mQkrbQO4Rx0YCQ.jpeg"

It has become pop-culture‚Äôs staple invention of the future thanks to shows like The Jetsons. Media‚Äôs portrayal of flying cars is usually fun, practical, and safe, but are they really a logical solution to vehicle traffic? In August of 2018, Neil deGrasse Tyson appeared as a guest on Joe Rogan Experience and discussed flying cars during the nearly 3 and a half hour long podcast. Interestingly enough, Tyson emphasized points about flying cars‚Äô logical use rather than what might be the main concern, safety. To summarize, Tyson explained the functionality of flying cars in the case of traffic. Single lane traffic is one-dimensional. Adding however many lanes on each side of the road will make the situation two-dimensional. The only improvement from that would be creating a third dimension. Flying cars would do just that, but as Tyson points out, we already have three-dimensional traffic. They are bridges and tunnels. And we even already have flying cars. They are called helicopters. Tyson then brings up the already existing problem with helicopters. They are noisy and disrupt the environment around them. My position on the flying car debate would be in agreement with Neil deGrasse Tyson. Flying cars would need to be very similar to helicopters which means they will most likely be noisy and disruptive to the surrounding area. Private and government helicopters need a clear landing zone for the former reason and daily use of this type of vehicle would only amplify the problem. As fun as they look, I do not believe the world is quite ready for flying cars. Here is the link to the podcast. The flying cars topic can be heard at the 2:57:40 mark. https://youtu.be/vGc4mg5pul4?t=10660 -- -- Software development student at MATC / Guitarist / Milwaukee Brewers fanatic Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*O2wNMvikpfBQgfAb4Eq3Fw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*O2wNMvikpfBQgfAb4Eq3Fw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*O2wNMvikpfBQgfAb4Eq3Fw.jpeg"

So instead of playing catch up later, let‚Äôs talk about the general guidelines of designing user experience for IoT. In other words, Iot UX and other long abbreviations are my topic of the day so prepare accordingly. What is IoT? I‚Äôm not going to dwell on this too much and go into tech specifications because it‚Äôs all been said before and you can follow the link for a longer explanation. But, just for the sake of clarity, today I‚Äôll be talking about UX in IoT devices, meaning devices with Internet connectivity and network capabilities that serve up unique functions and often deliver completely new features enabled by their programming and Internet capabilities. It‚Äôs not anything complicated even if you‚Äôre not much of a tech person, just think of an Apple Watch or a Smart TV as a basic example. How Does IoT UX Differ From Regular UX? UX design in websites and software is like an old friend. We all know what to expect from it, how to behave around it, and how to best use it for our benefit. Okay, the analogy got away from me. The point is that UX for sites/software is easy and we all know the standard paths, structures, and tricks there. UX for IoT includes all that and more, since you won‚Äôt just be designing the actions your users take. You need to make these minimalistic futuristic products feel like home, help users personalize them and integrate them with all of their other IoT devices. Besides, IoT, as you‚Äôd expect from the name, depends on the Internet. Which means a downed connection can lead to devices failing to respond or doing so with a delay. That‚Äôs a huge hit to the user experience and must be accounted for every single time. Similarly, in regular UX, the user presses a button and sees a result. In IoT, where remote controls are king, you need a way to make the user feel satisfied and notify them that their remote interaction bore some kind of fruit. Otherwise, there‚Äôll be repeat taps on buttons, frustrated grunts as no visual result is seen, and a whole lot of complaints. So yes, despite having some common ground with regular UX, IoT design still requires a new approach. Mostly, this comes from the fact that IoT isn‚Äôt just one uniform thing. There are few set rules on what constitutes an IoT product and it might very well be a network of things instead of just one screen. Any time you develop UX for IoT, you need to be prepared to work with wildly different functionalities while keeping the feel of the system consistent. Let‚Äôs see what are some of the most important aspects in IoT design. The Must Haves in IoT UX Design I‚Äôd actually call consistency a big priority, all because of how varied IoT products are. You should always strive to have some unifying elements in your design so that the consumer can intuitively navigate the functions of each product with little knowledge of it. In lieu of a 100-page instruction manual, you need to be providing a visual/tactile set of hints on how the product should be used and what it can do. Think, for example, of Amazon Echo. With just four buttons on top of it, the information presented to the user is quite sparse. However, the designer‚Äôs goal here was to make the icons on these buttons representative enough of their functions that the user could figure out the meaning of each on their own. And once the user knows how to turn the Echo on, its voice assistant capabilities will guide the process from there on out. This deceptive simplicity eases the consumer into using a product that‚Äôs actually quite intricate and I‚Äôd go as far as calling it great UX design. (Maybe not so much on the UI, the Echo Dot does look like an ashtray.) Another big factor is familiarity. The current generation of IoT devices serves up a smart take on old household staples: thermostats, light bulbs, home protection systems etc. Thankfully, their designers are (predominantly) smart enough to keep the look and the interactions true to these gadgets‚Äô predecessors. In other words, all of these feel familiar. One of my favorite examples is the learning thermostat. You pop it onto your wall, much like a regular thermostat. You set the temperature, exactly like you would with a regular thermostat. That‚Äôs it, that familiar process is all the device needs. Later on, it learns what temperature level seems to be preferable for you and sets itself automatically. This is a small quality-of-life improvement, sure, but it works wonders. The combination of a familiar device with novel functionality makes it an accessible gizmo that people want to try even if they‚Äôre not techy. Remember, there‚Äôs no programming, there aren‚Äôt any extra prompts such as ‚ÄúTemperature set. Sure you like it? Maybe a bit higher? What is this, the Arctic? Put some socks on.‚Äù. The designers of this device trusted in its features and the customers‚Äô familiarity with the thermostat to carry the experience. They kept it simple and it seems to have paid off in spades. Speaking of simplicity, that aspect of the design is not going anywhere. Regardless of the type of IoT device you‚Äôre making, the UX should be simple, easy to navigate, almost natural-feeling. Even if you‚Äôre working on some super niche gadget that will be used by skilled professionals, you must keep in mind that UX is never about the bare minimum effort needed to get to the point. It‚Äôs about delivering an experience that feels effortless, intuitive and, above all, simple. What‚Äôs the difference between effortless and simple you may ask? Well, let me put it this way: navigating a path like ‚ÄúMenu ‚Äî Options ‚Äî Sound Settings ‚Äî Mute Sound‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take much effort, especially on a responsive touch screen. So it is effortless, sure. But any UX designer that would call this simple must be slacking off. Every single action you take in that chain can be replaced with a mute button or prompt right on the menu screen or the ‚Äúhome page‚Äù. A simple one-stop prompt is all it takes and that‚Äôs what you should be aiming for. The industry and usage specifics will always matter, yes, but it‚Äôs much more valuable to have your UX be usable even when the consumer doesn‚Äôt feel like thinking too hard about what they‚Äôre doing. Come home, press a few buttons, your apartment is lit up, the Echo is awaiting command, the thermostat is already warming up the air, and the Smart TV is keeping the volume low because it‚Äôs the evening and you just want some quiet entertainment. That‚Äôs what IoT promises and that‚Äôs what good simple IoT design should deliver.

Searching and Sorting algorithms are very vast topics, and it‚Äôll be impractical trying to cover them in one article, and that too when the article is named ‚ÄúShort Notes‚Äù, it‚Äôll be against the purpose. So I‚Äôll be writing various short notes on various algorithms. Needless to say, one can find the need for searching an element in the given collection of data in many apps that are running in production right now in the market. Almost all the apps that we use, in some way or the other need to search data in a given pool of data. Generally, competitive coders learn many searching and sorting algorithms to make their code more efficient, but even if you are a developer and not into competitive programming, still you can‚Äôt remain untouched by the need of using searching and sorting algorithms. As I already listed some apps that we use daily need to search data, and as a developer, you will probably need to create such apps where data has to be searched from a given pool of data. I agree that most of the times we use database lookups and predefined functions, but still, as a good coder, you must know what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes. Therefore, for the next few articles, our short notes series will focus on searching and sorting algorithms. Also referred to as the sequential search, this is the most simple algorithm to search any given element in a given set of elements. The idea is to look at each and every element in the array and check it‚Äôs value Here‚Äôs an example of Linear Search in action: Being the easiest and simplest to implement searching algorithm, it is highly practical to use it when the given data set is small. Even though there are algorithms which give better runtimes, but still linear search can be used in medium-sized arrays as well. When many values have to be searched in the same list, it often pays to pre-process the list in order to use a faster method. For example, one may sort the list and use binary search, or build an efficient search data structure from it. Should the content of the list change frequently, repeated re-organization may be more trouble than it is worth.As a result, even though in theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. On larger arrays, it only makes sense to use other, faster search methods if the data is large enough, because the initial time to prepare (sort) the data is comparable to many linear searches(Source: Wikipedia) About a month ago I started an initiative named ‚ÄúDaily Codes‚Äù where I share one coding question daily, which is solvable in less than half an hour, and the total duration of this challenge is going to be 60 days.

The economy and the companies have recognized the great opportunities behind it. But what is necessary to convert production into Industry 4.0? A stocktaking.,inray Industriesoftware GmbH,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in inray Industriesoftware GmbH Follow -- 1 Listen Share In 2011, a working group developed the vision ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù. It describes the further development of modern production processes with the aim of ensuring that production is networked in the best possible way. As a result, production should control itself as far as possible and also optimize itself. All available data are to be used for optimization and control by exchanging them between the production participants. This also includes the products themselves, which report back the data of their life cycle and thus return findings to product development. German Chancellor Angela Merkel presented this vision in her opening speech at the Hannover Messe 2013, thus ensuring broad support. Since then, efforts to implement Industry 4.0 have been steadily stepped up because of the obvious advantages. (Read also: What is Industry 4.0?)But what is necessary to start with Industry 4.0? Industry 4.0 primarily describes the vision of optimal industrial production. Every production follows fixed and repetitive workflows. The processes are controlled and guided by various instruments. The focus is on systems in which production data is managed. The most common systems in production environments are: Customer orders, material stocks and resource planning are managed in the ERP system. Everything that is to be produced, with which material input and at which costs, is defined here. In the ERP, the final release for a production order is given, after which it is actually produced. Ideally, the production level is managed by a MES. Here, production orders from the ERP are enriched with machine-specific data so that machine recipes are created. In addition, machine data is recorded in order to calculate efficiencies, monitor consumption and conditions and to record and report any error situations. In a LIMS, quality-relevant data on the products and manufacturing materials are stored and processed. Many production processes are dependent on and controlled by LIMS data. The maintenance management system monitors the maintenance specifications of all machines and plant components in a production line and gives appropriate maintenance instructions in order to avoid breakdowns. Energy management records and evaluates energy consumption so that energy-saving measures can be developed and monitored. Production methods are then adapted and, in case of doubt, even actively influenced in order to avoid peak consumption. A SCADA system is used to monitor the production machines. Here, all process data can be viewed in real time and, if necessary, can be intervened in a controlling manner. Directly at the machine, the HMI is the interface to the control system for the operator. The operator can control the operation of the machine and set production and machine parameters. The actual machine is controlled by an intelligent module, the PLC. This is where the automation of the production process takes place. Not all of these systems are necessary for the implementation of Industry 4.0, but only the existence of such systems makes the path towards Industry 4.0 possible. In the first steps towards Industry 4.0, the communications for the implementation of the production processes are digitized and automated. Sub-areas that are not digitized by corresponding systems must then be equipped with electronic user interfaces in order to integrate them. The most trivial and usually initially predominant communication between the production systems is the exchange of paper forms. An approved production order is printed out, brought into production and executed there. During and after completion of the order, data is manually added to the forms in order to document component consumption, quality parameters and finished goods quantities. The completed forms are then entered manually again in the ERP system. This is the worst system coupling imaginable. This method is: In order to implement Vision Industry 4.0, communication between existing systems must be digital. This allows data to be exchanged in real time. Expensive and error-prone manual processes are eliminated. In addition, new possibilities arise if the systems can request data depending on the situation and thus react to special conditions. If, for example, a raw material is unexpectedly unavailable, alternative production orders can be called up in order to avoid a production stoppage. If these processes occur semi-automatically or even completely automatically, the goal of self-controlling production can be achieved. Communication between systems is a basic requirement for Industry 4.0. The controls with their sensors and actuators are the ones that get the machine to produce the final product. The controllers are therefore an important system that must be supplied with data automatically in order to implement Industry 4.0. However, the controller must meet certain requirements for this. A pure machine controller for the automation of a production process in the form of ‚ÄúIndustry 3.0‚Äù is designed to work autonomously. The data for production is entered by an operator at the HMI and then processed. For a production according to Industry 4.0, the programming of the PLC must have a digital supply with production orders and a corresponding interface for feedback. If this is not the default setting, the system programmer has to make improvements. This can vary depending on the complexity and degree of individualization of the machine. A series machine can possibly be provided with a software update, which the manufacturer makes available to all customers. An individual production machine must be reprogrammed by the respective programmer according to specially formulated requirements for the system coupling. For the general Industry 4.0 protocol ‚ÄúOPC UA‚Äù, many working groups are already busy making general specifications for such interfaces. These specifications are defined in the so-called ‚ÄúCompanion Specifications‚Äù (What is OPC UA and the Companion Specs?). In addition to the control systems, sensors are also increasingly capable of being addressed as independent systems. These provide data for monitoring, diagnosis and status analysis. If these are integrated into the respective systems, self-optimizations can be carried out, such as ‚Äúpredictive maintenance‚Äù, in which the maintenance requirement of a plant component is identified from the sensor data. The intelligent and networkable sensor systems, as well as the PLC controls with their couplings to the real machine, are referred to as CPS (Cyber Physical System). Such CPS are an important component for Industry 4.0. For Industry 4.0 communication, the networks must have connections that allow access according to precise rules using common mechanisms such as firewalls. In the normal IT environment, networking is usually already in place. The communication between the systems must be created by appropriate rules and configurations of the standard-interfaces. In the production network, there are often some areas where networking has not yet been established. Networking must then be built up fundamentally and the components with which communication is to take place must also be made network-compatible. The technologies for networking here range from simple network cables via WLAN to RFID and 5G technologies. Is the cloud a necessary requirement for Industry 4.0? No. But it is the logical next step. The described steps towards Industry 4.0 through communication between systems are not limited to production. Further connections can be created via the cloud, enabling production to control and optimize itself. One possible application is the product itself, which can report back its data to its own life cycle if it has sufficient technical equipment. The product reports its data to the cloud and the manufacturer can incorporate the data gained into the further development of the product or offer the necessary services for the product. In addition to the product, customers and suppliers can also be integrated into the production process via the cloud in order, for example, to coordinate delivery processes in real time or optimize the supply of raw materials. With the cloud, the idea of Industry 4.0 has an even wider sphere of influence. It is highly likely that the fourth industrial revolution will gain further momentum and gradually spread into all areas of industrial production. Socially, this will lead to major changes, as it did after the previous industrial revolutions. For consumers, there will always be better networked products with a high degree of individualization. As a result, factories will need fewer and fewer factory workers, but the demand for service and creative professions will rise sharply. From a technical point of view, more and more data will be exchanged faster and faster in order to realize optimal production. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*uqwq_34qyVua9vIoXwHO4A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*uqwq_34qyVua9vIoXwHO4A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*uqwq_34qyVua9vIoXwHO4A.png"

Soluna Holdings Inc Follow Clean Integration -- Listen Share By Larbi Loudiyi, VP of Energy at Soluna Since the early age of 18, I had a passion to create my own renewable energy company. I have always been aware of environmental issues and understood the impact they would have on future generations. While we live in a world where humanity has solved most of the problems it faces, it is important to be mindful of the solutions that have yet to come and how we can take part in creating them. One of my goals in life is to create environmental improvements that will make significant changes in the world. Soluna is the perfect illustration of this. We are a company that has taken on multiple challenges (technological, socio-economic, and ecological) and is trying to solve them all at once. By producing clean energy to power the blockchain, we are taking a big step towards a cleaner future and a better world. ‚ÄúWind power will be the dominant force behind the green power of the blockchain revolution.‚Äù Blockchain is a multibillion-dollar revolution with an equally large energy problem. The thousands of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects in operation today require massive amounts of cheap power ‚Äî and the resulting demands on the world‚Äôs energy resources are unsustainable. Just how much energy are we talking about? As of June 2018, mining for Bitcoin alone uses 71 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, equivalent to almost 10% of China‚Äôs annual energy usage. If Bitcoin was a country, it would now be the world‚Äôs 41st largest energy consumer, just behind Chile.1 What‚Äôs more, the energy demands of cryptocurrency mining and blockchain projects are growing at an astounding rate. These energy demands increased by many multiples in the last year alone. The blockchain-driven demand for energy has sparked a global scramble for inexpensive power, but fossil fuels should not fill the void. Instead, we believe the blockchain community should look to a greener solution. Renewable energy is becoming one of the most profitable and sustainable sources of energy in the world. When people consider scalable sources of renewable energy, the focus is primarily on solar and hydro. While these have potential, there is a more viable solution. At Soluna, we believe in the power of wind. Here we‚Äôll briefly illustrate how wind power works and explore why it is the most promising solution. People have been harvesting wind power for centuries for various applications, from sailing ships to grinding grain and pumping water. Wind is created by multiple natural phenomena, including planetary circulations (which generate jet streams and trade winds), topography, atmospheric waves, and storms such as hurricanes and typhoons. Its power varies greatly across the globe depending on nearby bodies of water, vegetation and differences in terrain. Today, we can generate electricity by capturing the power of wind with turbines. These tall towers catch the wind with their large blades, which act a lot like airplane wings. The combination of lift and drag turns the blades around a rotor connected to a shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. To generate a sizeable amount of electricity, it‚Äôs common to group many wind turbines together to create what‚Äôs known as a wind farm. Wind power depends on three key variables: When we look at the effectiveness of wind turbines and wind farms, we also consider its capacity factor. The capacity factor is the average power generated, divided by the rated peak power. It is based on both the characteristics of the turbine and the qualities of the site. Generally, attractive wind farms have capacity factors of 30% or higher.2 We expect the capacity factor of our Morocco project to be significantly higher than this figure and among the highest levels in the world. Let‚Äôs consider a real-life example. We have acquired the rights to a 37,000-acre wind farm site in Dakhla (southern Morocco). Dakhla is in one of the world‚Äôs windiest regions and is known as the kitesurfing capital of the world. By way of comparison, winds in New York City travel around 8.25 miles per hour during the windiest season of the year ‚Äî and in Dakhla, winds travel constantly at more than 22 miles per hour. The Moroccan coastline altogether has phenomenal potential as a wind resource: We estimate that it could supply half the energy consumption demands of the EU ‚Äî a truly massive amount of energy. How does wind energy stack up against solar and hydro energy? Across several key criteria, the wind comes out ahead, including: Soluna‚Äôs mission today fuels my dream as a young engineering student and today that the future will be dominated by renewable energy. Wind power will be the dominant force behind the green power of the blockchain revolution.

Below, is the first screen you‚Äôll see: The three character icons you see on the right are yours, every new player receives them. Your three workers represent you, with them you can team up in unions or guilds (term often used in multiplayer games) and commercial organizations to communicate with other players and get more work done, to make money, Prospectors Gold, the game currency. Which is needed for basic economic relations among players. Remember, this is a real-time multiplayer game. The five icons on your left are are actions, tools and jobs that you will need to use or do throughout the game to gain experience and gold. Each icons are: Build, mine, produce, unite with others and trade are all the actions that are required from your workers to gain Prospectors Gold. Most of these actions are done on different plots. Plots are sections on your map that you can buy or rent, but in order to buy or rent you‚Äôll need gold. Why do you need to rent a plot? To mine resources and store them, build buildings with these mined resources and of course, make gold. Remember that as a new player you do not own any gold nor own any tools. This will be your first step in the game: own gold and tools. Therefore, the only available jobs for you at the start are transporting jobs. Quite self-explanatory isn‚Äôt it? Transport goods from one plot to another. Receive gold once the job is done. Once you‚Äôve selected a transporting job, you will be able to choose one of your workers to perform the job, the time it will take to perform it and the pay. When you are ready, click the button: Perform. Now, one of your worker is busy, but you still have two other workings turning their thumbs waiting to be assigned to a job. Go for it, assign them to other available transporting jobs and make some gold. Wait! What? The gold I make in the game is worth cryptocurrency?! Yes, you heard that right. Now you own gold, and have the choice to either use it in the game or transfer it into PGL Tokens. In order to do so, you have to go on the two bolts on the top right of your screen. There, you‚Äôll see your email address and account name on the left and how much you have in gold and how much you have in PGL tokens. On the right side, you‚Äôll have a tab menu with: Deposit ‚Äî Withdraw ‚Äî Referrals ‚Äî Settings. Deposit gives you the option to send PGL Tokens you own into the game and transfer them in gold. With more gold, you are free to do more in the game. The rich wins (only here). You can stake PGL Tokens on prospectors.io in the Rewards section, which gives you extra PGL tokens that you can then deposit in your game account, and transfer into gold. More gold, means more game interaction. Withdraw is basically the reverse of deposit, convert your gold into PGL tokens and then exchange them at a decentralised exchange. Referrals is your referral link to invite others to play prospectors and receive gold. You will receive 20% from tax paid by your referral from rent payments, sold goods and real estate and earned salary. All in all, this game is very well done, with no issues so far while playing and quite an extensive amount of actions possible. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to see many games be this intuitive and easy to play in the blockchain space yet, therefore, seeing how Prospectors is piercing through the innovation of blockchain gaming, I have to bow to their hard work.I can‚Äôt wait to get more comfortable in the game and see where this leads us. On top of that, who doesn‚Äôt like to play a game and make tokens. Make sure to follow Wombat‚Äôs and Prospectors twitter accounts for announcements. -- -- 1 Wombat | Blog Community Director @ State of the DApps. Community Lead @mStable.

According to Urmia University officials, the Artemia Research Institute of the university has committed itself to transferring the technical know-how of the production of high-quality cysts to Kazakhstan. The dean of the University of Urmia Rahim Hobb-e Naqi referred to the contract as an example of cooperation between the countries of the region stating that both sides will benefit from it, ISNA reported On the sidelines of a ceremony in the city of Nur-Sultan, the ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Kazakhstan announced that the launch of the Artemia Cyst Production line in Kazakhstan is the beginning of extensive collaborations in the field of fisheries between the two states Kazakhstan has many saltwater lakes and rich sources of Artemia. Till now, the central Asian country was selling this basic aquaculture raw material at a low price. Artemia cysts are Brine Shrimp eggs with an excellent hatching rate. Artemia Cysts are well-known as the ideal live food for the first stages of larval shrimps. It is important to feed Artemia as soon as possible after hatching to take full advantage of the stored reserves. For a brief review of Iran‚Äôs achievements in various fields of science and technology, check the book ‚ÄúScience and Technology in Iran: A Brief Review‚Äù Artemia populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes, but not in oceans. Artemia are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity. The ability of the Artemia to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to extensive use of Artemia in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored for extended periods and hatched on demand to provide a suitable form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans. https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iran-to-transfer-know-how-of-processing-artemia-cysts-to-kazakhstan/ -- -- Latest news and views from Iran, Middle East and the World Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*qVn6M_fINt-lwgO7uKSnng.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*PCqXJo3C4S4Vi5PV.jpg"

Published on April 8, 2019 by Clint Chao, Moment Ventures They say that in order to be an effective VC, it‚Äôs important to have operational experience. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs entirely true, as Fred Wilson makes a strong argument that some of the industry‚Äôs most successful investors (including himself!) have zero operational experience and thrive because of it. But I certainly find great value in having it, as I often dig into my bag of in-the-trenches experiences at the companies I worked for earlier in my career while trying to help the entrepreneurs in our venture portfolio. Is Your Operational Experience Relevant to Startups? I suppose this largely depends on what kind of operational experience you bring to the table. Before becoming an investor, I grew up primarily as a startup sales executive and had the great (mis)fortune of being salesperson number one at C-Cube Microsystems, a 90‚Äôs startup with a mission to digitize all imaging and video applications, when everything was still analog. No one was begging to have this happen, but lots of companies were intrigued, and I got to sit in the pole position of starting up a customer and revenue engine that enabled us to bring a couple of unknown technologies called JPEG and MPEG to the world. In the early days, I was sifting the serious leads from the tire kickers, resulting in lots of dialing for design wins. Eventually, we started to get noticed. One of my responsibilities was nurturing the relationship with a motivated little startup customer who had the bold vision to eliminate the need for cable networks by beaming TV signals over satellites, and they wanted to become a lighthouse customer for us as they critically needed our video components to make the system work. That company was DirecTV, and we knew their success meant a ton of industry validation for us, so we had to make sure we kept them happy. Of course, half the battle was managing our own side of the relationship as we were building our products with the customer right at our side. We went on to become the dominant provider of MPEG solutions in the industry, helping to launch other household name solutions like DVD, video conferencing and even digital ultrasound imaging, each with a different motivated customer pushing us along. I wouldn‚Äôt trade those experiences for anything, as we encounter startups every day who are aspiring to disrupt industries, and finding and managing early lighthouse customers is more art than science. Meanwhile, my Moment Ventures partner Ammar used to head up corporate development and M&A for Cisco, one the most storied tech companies on the planet during the years when they acquired dozens of fast growing companies that serve as the backbone of much of its product portfolio today. Safe to say that in those days, if you were a communications startup, Cisco was the big dog, and he represented a possible massive exit for your company. His experience as a strategic buyer of companies gives terrific perspective to young entrepreneurs on the sell side that are often facing this experience for the first time. Ammar‚Äôs keen sense for technology strategy in the eyes of a would-be acquirer and mine for influencing a company‚Äôs product pipeline with a lens on what your earliest customers need are just two of the things we try to bring to our portfolio companies every day. We love that we lived our early professional lives in the trenches, and do what we can to pass on this experience to our current and future entrepreneurs. What About Tech Founders? But how about tech startup founders, the true stars of the startup game? Do they need relevant operational experience to steward their companies into the waters of an industry that they are seeking to disrupt? Again, I think the answer will vary depending on what kind of experience, but if you ask us, we love it when founders bring that knowledge to the table. We think it really helps for them to know and appreciate the nuances about the behavior of constituents within an industry ecosystem, and be keen to the inner workings of an industry where perhaps many others aren‚Äôt. The Future of Work and Transforming Behavior One key aspect of our Future of Work investment thesis at Moment Ventures is to invest in B2B startups that use technology in a way to transform the behavior of workers and customers within a large industry vertical, such as construction, logistics, food, e-commerce, education and others. We seek people who have lived part of their lives in the trenches of an industry, and have become driven by a deep sense of why and how technology can create new efficiencies to the workflow of the space, which if successful, brings about transformative industry behavior. Many of the workers or customers in a specific industry have been doing things the same way for years, if not decades, so startups targeting these verticals face a steep climb as they attempt to change the behavior of an industry that is reticent to change altogether. But in looking for investment opportunities, we always get much more confidence when an entrepreneur has spent time in that industry and knows what makes its workers and customers tick. Examples from the Trenches Many of the entrepreneurs that we‚Äôve invested in started their journey deep in the bowels of their target industry where they identified a fundamental inefficiency in the way work gets done: Technology Alone is Not a Solution for Many Industries One of the more concerning trends in recent years is when companies demonstrate the power and capabilities of their technologies as half-baked functions rather than solutions. While it‚Äôs certainly entertaining to see videos of a robot climbing up a hill, a dinosaur hotel receptionist or any other YouTube videos depicting a grim, dystopian future based on technology running without people, oftentimes these demo videos do more harm than good, putting the fear in people that their jobs are at stake and technology will replace entire labor forces. At least the hotel dinosaur revolution was short-lived and has since faced extinction. Silicon Valley gets rightfully criticized for lacking the empathy and understanding of what it takes to ask an industry‚Äôs workers to change decades-long behaviors. We credit those entrepreneurs that have lived in the trenches to truly understand what it takes to cause an industry to transform, bringing along with it the opportunities for the workers in those industries to up their game. Let‚Äôs Reimagine Work If you are an entrepreneur living inside the trenches of an industry where you have identified an opportunity to use technology to transform how work gets done, hit us up, as we‚Äôd love to hear your story! Coupling your direct industry experience with the technology to bolster the efficiency of how work gets done enables us to reimagine ways that people can get work done in industries such as logistics, food, healthcare, oil & gas, education, e-commerce or even the technology industry itself.

A growing number of employers and insurers encourage employees to use family-planning apps, such as those developed by Ovia Health. In femtech, we see startups changing women‚Äôs health technology.",ReadWrite,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in ReadWrite Follow ReadWrite -- Listen Share There‚Äôs a fresh buzz about femtech among investors. Some believe the vertical will serve as the next speculative cash cow. According to a Rock Health venture fund analysis, 77% of surveyed consumers say that they have no problem sharing their data with physicians. However, 86% of those respondents expressed that companies shouldn‚Äôt collect health-related data without consent. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) permits companies to sell consumer data ‚Äî as long as the information is anonymized. Already, major corporations such as IBM are cashing in on the healthcare information mining industry. An example of taking data from devices is fitness, health, and femtech mobile apps. Insurers and employers aggressively encourage workers to use femtech apps developed by Ovia. As an example, Activision Blizzard gaming is one of several companies that leverage Ovia apps to monitor employee health. The apps collect sensitive information regarding fertility, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy development. Activision Blizzard uses the information to determine how many of its employees are pregnant, attempting to conceive or facing a high-risk pregnancy. Company representatives admit there was backlash each time they introduced a new employee monitoring technology. It also helps that the company incentivized employees to use Ovia apps by paying them $1 a day. Over time, Activision Blizzard employees have developed a tolerance for company health monitoring. Analysts forecast phenomenal growth for the femtech industry. However, some start-ups enter the vertical with dubious intentions. Several entrepreneurs have entered the fintech industry with apps that have little value other than to collect user data for resale. The femtech revolution can‚Äôt spin up fast enough. Today, women around the world face problematic health issues. For instance, studies show that 70% of women diagnosed with postpartum depression conceal or minimize their symptoms. Globally, physicians diagnose 10% of pregnant women and 13% of women who have just given birth with postpartum depression, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Women‚Äôs health is especially important because of their role in influencing and caring for children and family members. Many women, however, downplay their symptoms. Femtech may help to improve the well-being of women. Today, it‚Äôs a multimillion-dollar market fueled by pelvic health devices, menstruation monitors, and pink fitness wearables. As the femtech industry emerges, a growing number of speculators pour money into startups that create technology to address women‚Äôs health needs. Still, physicians must continue to contend with a significant segment of the female population who prefers timeworn search engine queries to manage their health needs. Today, retailers place femtech products such as Cora alongside popular feminine products such as Tampax. In the future, researchers envision smart tampons that collect biological samples for monthly testing. Such an innovation could help physicians diagnose women‚Äôs illnesses like cervical cancer and endometriosis. With industry insiders forecasting that femtech will rake in $50 billion annually by the year 2025, these visions of high-tech women‚Äôs care products could well become a reality. Historically, the technology industry, the healthcare field, and the business world, in general, have have overlooked women‚Äôs needs. Among leading venture capital circles, for instance, women only represent 7% of partners. Current decision-makers in the women‚Äôs health products industry treat the vertical as a luxury, rather than a necessity. Unfortunately ‚Äî just as with tampons and sanitary napkins ‚Äî retailers tax women‚Äôs health products as luxury items. Nevertheless, some women‚Äôs advocates are thrilled that the male-dominated business world is paying more attention to women‚Äôs needs. At the same time, there‚Äôs a doubt as to the usefulness of some femtech products. Some people wonder what percentage of femtech products offer real value and how much of the vertical is merely marketing hype pedaled for profit. There is one line of femtech products that have earned the approval of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Glow and Natural Cycles are the first fertility apps to receive marketing clearance from the agency. While women can download both apps for free, subscription fees for advanced functionality range from nominal to exorbitant. Physicians offer a word of caution about the apps. The apps can collect a considerable amount of information, enabling more accurate fertility tracking. Still, they‚Äôre not 100% foolproof. In an increasingly connected society, people may come to expect too much from technology. Despite doctor‚Äôs warnings, however, both apps have stellar reviews from tens of thousands of users in the Google Play store. Hopefully, more truly beneficial femtech offerings will emerge as the industry matures.

https://medium.com/@griffinkenya/in-insurance-old-is-not-gold-9d714011e96b?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,"In insurance, Old is not Gold",Written by Griffin Motor App,Griffin Motor App,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Griffin Motor App Follow -- 1 Listen Share It has been a year since our team met for the first time, and with a blink of an eye, that year has come to pass. *Insert Nostalgic sound effects here* For 365 days, we spent countless hours brainstorming, problem solving, interviewing and receiving feedback from over a hundred customers. There were endless nights spent coding, fuelled by bottomless cups of smooth, rich flavoured Kenyan coffee. I guess now is a good time to share what we have been up to ahead of our official launch at the end of the year. In insurance, old is not gold. What does this even mean, you may ask? Fret not, let us explain‚Ä¶. For a long time, motorists in Kenya purchased their mandatory car insurance from any of the 37 general insurance companies. Yet, this sheer number of competitors is not reflected in the availability of choice and product differentiation. In fact, most car insurance policies are essentially a ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù product, with only slight variations in their benefits and excesses. Since car insurance is mandatory, customers have no option but to pick one insurer and the process of buying from that insurer is never a pleasant one. For our readers who have the privilege of not going through the insurance process, allow us to create a mental picture of how it‚Äôs like..‚Ä¶ Whether dealing with an insurance company or an intermediary such as a broker or agent, the customer has to commute, park their car, and wait to talk to the agent or broker, only to be redirected to do a valuation of the car at the good old AA. A customer may skip this step but they will risk a clashing situation with their insurer in case of any major damage. Two weeks later, the valuation report is ready, the customer travels again to purchase their car insurance. Consequently, they will leave the insurer‚Äôs offices with an insurance sticker, an emptier wallet and a promise that if something happens, ‚Äúdepending on the circumstances,‚Äù your claim may be paid. The hope is that you won‚Äôt need your policy, because settling a claim can be a warrior journey with an uncertain ending. So what will make Griffin any different? For the past year, we asked ourselves these questions: What is preventing insurance companies from providing better products and experiences? Why is there no digital offer? Why is the insurance penetration low? How can we make customers happier ? What are the real problems customers are facing? With these questions in mind and many more, we built the Griffin Car Insurance App. Our mission? To not only create a new bond between the driver and their car, but also to improve and customise their driving and insurance experience. The Griffin‚Äôs customer journey is unlike anything a traditional insurance company can offer, as we believe the journey is not just about insuring a car, but rather about the customer improving and optimizing their driving over time. The Griffin experience is tailored to make insurance seamless and transparent. Our users are able to purchase their policy at any time and have their insurance certificate and policy documents delivered the next day at their convenience, unlike the current practice where policy documents take months to be sent by post office. The time required for claims settlement will also shrink, as claims management is fully automated, and for certain cases, claims processing does not require human intervention. Griffin customers will receive real-time alerts to notify them about the status of their policy or claim, thus avoiding the repetitive phone calls and follow ups that customers used to deal with to resolve their claim. The Griffin App offers several other services and features aimed at making life easier for motorists. Users will be able to request rescue and emergency services on the App and receive accurate estimations and updates of arrival times. Customers will also have access to a services map to quickly find service providers such as garages, hospitals, and others. With Griffin, customer care has been made easier through our direct messaging and chat with our reps via the App, turning a draining experience into a pleasant one. Talk of A1 experience ;) The Griffin App launch is planned for the end of 2019, so whether you‚Äôre #TeamAndroid or #TeamiOS, you will be able to access the App and transform your relationship with your insurance and car. Currently, the App is in beta testing available under request for android users to test.

Most people view it as difficult to understand, time-consuming, and impersonal. Lovys is aiming to change this. Lovys is an all-in-one digital insurance provider that is transforming the customer experience. With its simplified user platform, subscription-based model, and transparent interface, Lovys is well-equipped to take on the insurance industry. Individual items can be registered and insured via Lovys and policies and claims can be handled within seconds. I was lucky enough to get some time with Antonio, the CFO of Lovys, to learn a little more about his experiences, the insurtech landscape, and what he‚Äôs working on at Lovys. Antonio, thank you for taking the time to talk. I‚Äôm excited to dive into your background and hear a little more about what brought you to Lovys. How do you think your previous experiences at JP Morgan and XP Group have contributed to the way you approach and solve problems at Lovys? JP Morgan was a great school. I‚Äôve worked with incredible people in London, NY, and Geneva, from the best schools and most impressive backgrounds, driving my aptitude to work hard and smart, delivering a first class business in a first class way. As an analyst I was also exposed to a variety of financial services, from financial markets to large financing transactions, applying my macroeconomic background and managing projects with different teams across the bank and regions. At XP, I was part of the founding team of the company‚Äôs presence in Europe, building financial solutions from scratch. I was able to combine my financial competences, while testing my entrepreneurial skills in a fast growing and innovative project. Both experiences allowed me to develop complementary hard skills that I apply everyday at Lovys, from financial modeling to project management. Lastly, the Lovys team shares a strong customer-centric culture ‚Äî we are always thinking about how we can ‚Äúwow‚Äù our customers by providing truly different and innovative solutions. So, you have spent time in London, NY, and Geneva, and Lovys brought you to Paris. Many people might think that London would be a natural home for Lovys, as it is known as a hub for fintech and insurtech. Could you talk a little about why the headquarters are in Paris, as opposed to London or another European city? London is clearly an attractive city for European startups, however at this moment Brexit poses too many risks for an insurtech to cope with. Paris was an excellent choice. The local ecosystem is developing very fast. Many large French companies are based in Paris, from financial services, real estate and digital companies, allowing us to quickly launch product and distribution partnerships. The local insurance market is also quite traditional in different dimensions, which allows us to quickly stand out. I have to reinforce that we are very thankful for how well the French people and companies have welcomed our project. In a recent local large fintech event, we found out that Jo√£o (Lovys founder/CEO) was the only non-French fintech founder in France. In addition to that, we have a very international team : 10 nationalities in over 5 countries. Do you find that there is any sort of difficulty with language or cultural barriers? For all our non-French team majority, not being French and doing some funny accents and mistakes while speaking the language, has never been a barrier for us to do business here. Actually, all our partners are very proud that we make a true effort to always interact in French. In the last few years, we are really seeing a strong shift in consumer preferences ‚Äî consumers want simplicity, predictability, and transparency. This is especially evident for products and services that have historically been viewed as complicated and time consuming. Insurance very clearly falls into that category ‚Äî what are some unique ways in which Lovys is solving this pain point for consumers? I fully agree with the trend. We have seen how quickly B2C fintechs have been growing in the US and Europe. We believe insurtech is 2‚Äì3 years late versus fintechs, and that customers are about to learn how they can benefit from technology based companies for their protection needs. In addition, the insurance sector has suffered a significant evolution in the last 20/30 years, unfortunately not necessarily for the better. Consumers used to rely on brokers that charged high commissions and lacked transparency, but provided an important advisory role to customers who tend to underestimate risks. With the digitalization of insurance purchase through comparison websites, consumers are facing strong price-incentives and purchase products that are disintegrated from the corresponding management/claims platform, which have led to under protection and poor experiences. To solve these problems, Lovys has created a subscription model for protection, built around the customer, that: Traditional insurance firms are not 100% digital and lack efficiency in many ways, but they remain successful due to brand recognition and customer trust, which often takes years to build. In one of my previous posts, I write about the importance of brand loyalty ‚Äî how does Lovys plan on strengthening its brand over time? Brand and reputation is definitely important in a business in which people rely an important part of their income to protect themselves from adverse events in the future. Lovys is investing strongly in features that enhance our reliability, for example ‚Äî instant claims handling through our app. We also work with several of the most reputable insurance companies in Europe that take on the insurance risk of our portfolio. To build on that a little more ‚Äî can you talk a little bit about which larger insurers you currently work with and how you see that collaboration evolving over time? Some of the largest insurance companies, like Generali, MAIF or La Parisienne, take on our insurance risk today. We have a very strong partnership that has enabled us to deliver the innovation that our customers expect up to today. Earlier this year, Lovys raised 3.3MM EUR in seed funding from MAIF Avenir, Portugal Ventures, and Plug & Play. What are some goals that Lovys is planning to achieve with this funding? In the short-term we focused mostly on growing our team. We‚Äôve recently acquired Ockert, an insurtech focused on data analytics and fraud detection algorithms. Today we have a very strong and experienced team of 25, with one of the strongest tech stacks across European insurtechs. Now we are focused on developing our platform and features for our clients. We also have a strong product pipeline that we will roll-out during the upcoming months. Finally, we‚Äôve been very focused on growth. We are currently facing an exponential growth from both B2C and B2B2C distribution channels. While developing and growing the Lovys platform, that type of feedback have you gotten on the product and platform while in beta mode and how are you using that feedback to better prepare for your launch next month? We work on a constant feedback loop setup. All feedback we receive from customers and partners is considered, and we always think on how we can improve the technology and insurance products to improve customer experience. We have an exciting roadmap of launches coming up, I hope we can touch base in the near future to hear your feedback. Definitely, really looking forward to that! Lastly, what advice do you have for people that are tinkering with an idea or thinking of starting their own company? Starting a company is a very difficult challenge. The skill set one needs is very vast and chances one fails are very high. More importantly, it is often a solitary adventure often involving personal sacrifices, and to stay the course one needs to be surrounded by great people, advisors, family and friends. Starting a company is also a very different challenge compared to joining a later stage fast growing company, and one should be conscious about it. My advice is that before starting, one spends significant time (part-time/weekends/nights) with other entrepreneurs that are going through the typical pre-seed / seed challenges. I‚Äôm sure other entrepreneurs would be glad to have an extra pair of hands, and one would better realize whether such adventure fits or doesn‚Äôt fit professional and personal ambitions.

https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/the-current-vs-future-state-of-distributed-ledger-technology-e146d90a3099?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,The Current vs Future State of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT),By The Crypto Oracle on ALTCOIN MAGAZINE,The Crypto Oracle,No Author URL,N/A,37 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Crypto Oracle Follow The Capital -- 2 Listen Share A Comprehensive Overview of the Entire Blockchain Ecosystem One of the foundational activities of human civilization is the exchange of value between people. History has proven that societal advancement is very closely correlated with the velocity of value exchange within its population. Instead of an individual needing to master every trade, people can specialize in some skill and exchange it for other products and services they want or need. Increased value exchange is at the heart of heightened collaboration, which makes life easier and allows people to obtain far more value than they would by themselves. Humans exchange all types of value, whether it be time, labor, products, access, or information (data). The most basic way to exchange value is bartering, but it‚Äôs only efficient when both parties possess items the other side demands. What happens when you want something someone else is selling, but you don‚Äôt own any items they want? Money was invented as a way to solve those inefficiencies by creating a universally accepted medium for storing value. Money was the catalyst of early markets and fostered many new trading opportunities that were not possible with barter. Alongside money, came the proliferation of record keeping (accounting). To properly value different goods, services, and even money itself, there needs to be verifiable ways to calculate and prove value. For example, when an investor wants to know if a company is healthy, they look at their accounting books. Record keeping was introduced as a mathematical method to properly monetize value and record activity/ownership within open markets. It brought increased trust to valuations and in combination with money, opened up the credit markets. As trade evolved from barter to markets, people found themselves with opportunities to conduct business with unknown entities. With new opportunities, came increased risk, primarily counterparty risk ‚Äî the probability and likelihood that the other party in a contractual obligation might default on their obligations. To solve this problem, trusted third parties emerged to facilitate value exchange amongst entities that didn‚Äôt trust each other. The most common were banks since banks had the capital to finance upfront costs and the legal expertise to effectively settle defaults. Trusted third parties brought trust and financing to value exchange, which allowed markets to expand globally. Fast forward hundreds of years and the Internet completely changed the infrastructure in which information can be communicated. Information not only moves at unprecedented speeds, but its reach is international. The free flow of instant information around the world has and still is transforming the speed of exchange and global consensus around valuations. Thanks to the Internet and other breakthroughs in digital technology, there is another wave of infrastructure that could completely shift the way in which society monetizes and exchanges value. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a general term used to describe the family of technologies deriving from or built to support distributed ledgers. The most widely known of these technologies is blockchain, which has its own subsets (public, federated, private), but there are a variety of others, including smart contracts, oracles, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), among many others. The purpose of DLT is to replace trusted third parties that process and store records in a centralized manner with decentralized computer protocols where every user on the network verifies the accuracy and authenticity of all records in one singular, non-centrally-owned ledger. Instead of a central server processing and storing records, thousands of computers (nodes) form continual consensus around the changes in record keeping (state changes) of the network. Each node participates in consensus and stores a copy of the ledger. Some people refer to it as the stateful Internet, since it‚Äôs an open network that by design keeps timestamped records of all transactional activity. The current Internet is stateless. DLT not only keeps records of transactional activity, but it can digitize the ownership of assets (tokenization) and processes contract logic (smart contracts). Smart contracts allow changes in record keeping to be dependent on ‚Äúif/then‚Äù conditional statements, such as ‚Äúif this happens, then execute this transaction.‚Äù DLT replaces current system rule ‚Äî a probabilistic world where value exchange is run by humans and so rules will probably be followed, with system law ‚Äî a deterministic world where value exchange is run by immutable computer code and exchange is determined directly by reliable, unbiased, and tamperproof data. The scope of DLT is rather vast and sometimes hard to fathom at first because like the Internet, DLT can be applied to any current real-world business model, operational process, regulatory framework, and specifically to create a digital asset of specific units of data (tokenization). Since its use is so wide scale, speculation over its value was rampant in 2017. Companies were raising millions, sometimes even hundreds of millions of dollars because they were taking the novelty of DLT and applying it to any of the aforementioned spaces. It‚Äôs directly analogous with creating an Internet company for all previous brick and mortar business during the .com boom. However, like all things too good to be true, the magic wore off, reality crept in, and the speculative bubble popped in 2018. Many Internet companies went through a similar phase, as even the biggest tech giants of today, like Amazon and IBM, had substantial drops in their stock price from the peak of the bubble. While most companies failed, several went on to be to the biggest companies in the world. In fact, Microsoft became the third trillion dollar company by market cap, joining Apple and Amazon as the other two to reach that feat. With the DLT space having gone through a full market cycle in only two years, it‚Äôs important to take a step back and assess the current state of DLT. There will likely be very valuable networks that come out of this new sector and a few could even become the most powerful and valuable networks on the planet. To properly identify the most valuable of these technologies, it‚Äôs important to understand the present reality and use it as a baseline to accurately predict the future direction. To aid in the analysis, five key components of the DLT ecosystem will be dissected from a current vs. future perspective. These include development, use cases, education, investment/price action, and politics. Every distributed ledger must overcome similar obstacles, mainly the Byzantine generals problem ‚Äî getting different entities to work towards the same goal (consensus) despite the risk of one entity (malicious actor) corrupting the whole network by acting in their own self-interests. Malicious actors can generally attack in two ways: double spending ‚Äî spending the same coin twice, and 51% attacks ‚Äî gaining majority control of the network. Blockchains prevent double spending by maintaining a chronologically-ordered, time-stamped transaction ledger that‚Äôs held by every node in the network. The ledger is accurately maintained as long as one entity doesn‚Äôt get control of 51% of the nodes. If they do, they can create false transactions and use their 51% consensus to get the transactions accepted into the ledger. While blockchains have solved the Byzantine generals problem, they face another hurdle if they want to see mass adoption, scalability. The blockchain trilemma is the problem of developing distributed ledgers with decentralization (permissionless), security (correctness), and scalability (cost efficiency). According to Vitalik Buterin, author of the Ethereum whitepaper, ‚Äúblockchains systems at most can only have two of the following three properties.‚Äù The problem arises from the reality that security, like against 51% attacks, is dependent on maximizing decentralization, while scalability is dependent on minimizing decentralization. The trilemma forces projects to make technological tradeoffs that create strengths, but come with weaknesses. Generally, public blockchains like BTC and ETH offer security and decentralization, but poor scalability. More centralized blockchains like EOS and permissioned/private blockchains like Corda and Hyperledger offer scalability and security, but poor decentralization. Blockchain alternatives like DAGs offer scalability, but unproven decentralization and security. Given the tradeoffs, DLT development has been split amongst those favoring particular tradeoffs. Public blockchains offer their core features of providing maximum security and creating the best network effects due to decentralization. However, they have four main problems that have to be addressed. While there is active development on improving the base layer protocol of distributed ledgers, there has also been a shift in thought in terms of how to solve it. Instead of making the base layer perfect, many developers are building second layer solutions to fix the on-chain problems. The idea is to build second layer networks on top of the underlying blockchain to tackle certain issues, as opposed to the base layer solving everything. There are a variety of protocols offering off-chain solutions for scaling, interoperability, and privacy. It will be interesting to see if second layer solutions fix the inherent problems of distributed ledgers or only offer band-aid solutions with their own tradeoffs. The other side of development revolves around more centralized blockchains and permissioned/private blockchains. The idea is that without cost-effective scalability, DLT will never take off. Therefore, sacrificing some decentralization for scalability is seen as the most practical solution. EOS is a public blockchain that does so by limiting the number of nodes that can participate in block producing consensus to 21. Hyperledger and Corda are permissioned blockchains that only allow users that have been granted permission. Private blockchains offer great scalability and privacy but don‚Äôt offer the same level of network effects and deterministic guarantees that come with full decentralization. The rating agency Moody‚Äôs expressed such concerns, stating ‚ÄúPrivate/centralized blockchains are more exposed to fraud risk because system design and administration remains concentrated with one or few parties.‚Äù However, it seems clear that they‚Äôre the preferred choice of business right now. It‚Äôs a much more private and controlled environment for companies to test the waters of DLT. As noted by the wide disparity amongst projects, DLT is very much in its early days of R&D, testing, and initial implementation. Different technologies are in different stages and no one really knows which tech is going to prove most successful. Maybe one type of blockchain becomes dominant, maybe some blockchains work better in certain industries, maybe layer two solutions solve blockchain problems, or maybe some blockchain alternatives solve the trilemma. There are more questions than answers right now. One thing that is certain is DLT needs more people working on the problem. Many companies want to hire developers to aid in their experimentation with DLT, but find it hard to acquire good talent. A small pool of talent also results in code that takes longer to mature since there are fewer eyeballs looking for bugs and vulnerabilities. While blockchains have proven resilient to hacks, smart contracts still need to improve their code for any type of industry use. In the end, blockchain is only as good as its code, so growing the developer community is vital. Currently, there are four main use cases which utilize DLT, have provable and working solutions, and provide actual real-world value. 1. Censorless Exchange of Value ‚Äî Public DLT allows for anything of value to reliably flow from the only party to another without the threat of any form of censorship. The most widely known form of censorless value exchange in the DLT space is a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin ‚Äî the first decentralized, permissionless, and uncensorable form of digitized global money. While laws might discourage participation in the network, it would be hard to stop an open blockchain like Bitcoin. There are however a variety of other markets, such as payment processors and social media outlets, that are unable to censor transactions or content based off political disagreement. A good example is Steemit, a blockchain that host and directly monetizes users content, such as blogs or videos, without the threat of censorship. With centralized media platforms increasingly censoring and demonetizing content, platforms like Steemit have proven useful at avoiding censorship and giving users digital ownership of their data. Famous YouTuber PewDiePie, who has 94 million subscribers, has recently announced that he would start live-streaming on DLive, an content sharing app built on the Lino blockchain (formerly built on Steemit). 2. Tokenization of Assets ‚Äî Another major use case is the tokenization of assets. Thanks to smart contracts, blockchains like Ethereum can take anything of value and turn it into a tradable token with a unique and publicly verifiable identity. All kind of assets can be tokenized, such as equity, title ownership, products, and derivatives contracts. Not only does it keep an accurate and censorless record of ownership, but the blockchain opens up new markets with increased liquidity for these assets to trade. Tokenization was the main driver of the 2017 speculative bubble in DLT because it gave rise to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for utility tokens and Security Token Offerings (STOs) for tokenized equity. While ICOs specifically got way out of hand in terms of their valuations, it‚Äôs still a proven and useful way to raise money in a decentralized manner. ICOs and STOs decentralized venture capital investment by allowing average citizens from anywhere in the world to participate in early fundraising rounds. Tokenization has led a to new asset class called utility tokens ‚Äî a representation of value for network access and usage, which is limited in supply. It‚Äôs one of the best ways to monetize open protocols. Tokenization has also lead to the proliferation of stablecoins ‚Äî fiat currency on the blockchain, and exchange tokens ‚Äî utility tokens for exchange discounts/usage. Stablecoins and exchange tokens have proven instrumental for traders wanting to hedge against volatility and save money on exchange activity. 3. Security of Asset Storage ‚Äî An overlooked use case that shouldn‚Äôt be ignored is the ability for a blockchain to become a more secure and reliable database. While distributed databases are faster and quite a common model with a high level of security, DLT has benefits over distributed databases for uptime (generally more nodes), ease of adding new nodes, and ease of connecting to the network, which results in lower costs of running. While exchanges, certain smart contracts, and personal computers are sometimes hacked, the fundamental blockchain protocol has proven resilient to hackers thanks to due to node consensus, data immutability, and data provenance. Secure asset storage is also important from an ownership standpoint. A person‚Äôs digital identity, which includes all types of metadata about them, is very valuable to companies today. Blockchains offer a way for someone to monetize and own, both their personal data and application data. Steemit was really the first platform to facilitate social media activity, but not own any data or require/store any personal information. In fact, the user owns their own content and it‚Äôs directly monetized by the platform. It‚Äôs different to something like Facebook, which keeps all the users' data and owns the content (which it often sells for money). 4. Security of Asset Exchange ‚Äî Given the reliability and immutability of the network, blockchains make better execution engines for contracts. While smart contracts are young, they are poised to potentially be the biggest evolution of the entire DLT space. Smart contracts are not just for ICOs and tokenization but can be used in a variety of industries to replace backend systems involved in contract execution, maintenance, and settlement. Companies implementing smart contracts could see a massive reduction in the overhead involved in paperwork, dispute resolution, data entry, custodial, and regulatory compliance. While some companies might not care about censorship, they could find the secure and reliable nature of processing asset exchange to be very appealing. While one could argue that there are smaller use cases like decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, supply chain, digital identity, interbank settlement, networking protocols, anonymous money, and remittances, they are still relatively small in scale and have underlying issues that have to be addressed before being considered widespread successes. Unfortunately, current use cases are still rather niche, with no widely used DApp yet. Permissioned DLT has seen a ton of development too, although no concrete adoption. Many large corporations are experimenting with permissioned DLT by producing proofs-of-concept, running trials, and announcing production plans. Some notable examples include: There are also many DLT focused startups with corporate partners working on solutions: Finally, there are a variety of organizations and consortiums being constructed to foster exploration and collaboration between businesses, governments, and technology firms. The backbone of any technology movement is the populous, or at least some small portion of it, having a fundamental understanding of how the technology works, why it‚Äôs valuable, and how it‚Äôs going to change the future. Unfortunately, the current knowledge base surrounding DLT is poor to nonexistent. This is true for developers too, as turnover and failed startups are quite common in the DLT space. It‚Äôs hard to blame people though, given the technology‚Äôs infancy and rapid changes in development. There is simply a high barrier to entry for most people given its technical, constantly changing nature. A large majority of big tech movements are contained in the beginning to small communities of university-led research initiatives, Venture Capital (or other investment arms with access to future tech perspectives), and individuals with knowledge and access to bleeding-edge tech and scientific innovations. Though it may seem big to those involved on a daily basis, the DLT space is still a relatively small, niche community. Within the DLT community, there is still a fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to the technology. On one end you have traders that are only in it for the money, and on the other end you have investors that don‚Äôt have a strong knowledge base for whatever reason. For example, smart contracts are one of the most important technologies within DLT. Smart contracts generate a lot of interest due to their potential for automation and cost reduction, but people are not aware that smart contracts are limited without oracles feeding real-world data into the contracts. When looking at the greater mainstream, education is much further behind. Most people still have no concept of blockchain and why it might be valuable, let alone other topics like smart contracts, oracles, and state channels. Most people around the world have still never even heard of Bitcoin. Those that have usually know it in a general sense as money, but can‚Äôt make any distinction between blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin. They tend to lump all terms in the DLT space together as meaning cryptocurrency like Bitcoin when in reality cryptocurrency is just one use case. Mainstream media and public figures such as Jamie Dimon played a large role in tarnishing the image of the space by issuing public statements about it being a speculative bubble and used for crime. However, instead of paying attention to what is being said, individuals should consider the actions of these same corporations and governments more meaningful. If the technology is worthless then why are the IEEE and The Accord Project teaming up to develop techno-legal standards for smart contract applications? Why is ISO/TC 307 trying to develop international standards for DLT technologies? Why did the U.S. government pass the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act to digitize the federal government? All these actions of the market makers depict a technology that is not only here to stay but will become an integral part of baseline societal interaction. Standardizing the terms and technology that make up DLT will go along way towards improving the education surrounding the space. The DLT landscape has grown considerably in the last few years. According to CoinMarketCap, as of April 29th, 2019 there are roughly 2140 cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalization of roughly 171 billion. While this is low compared to the peak of over 800 billion in early January 2018, it is significantly higher than the start of 2017 which was just under 20 billion. Unfortunately, most of the current price action seems to be driven by speculation and hype rather than the actual value. There are a variety of trader and whale groups that pump and dump coins, gimmicky promotions to hype coins, and exchanges manipulating markets using insider trading, bots, and wash trading. Hypenomics and pumpamentals have even become popular phrases because traders are watching like hawks for hype-fueled pumps. While it‚Äôs hard to say for sure, it does feel as though whales and exchanges dominate the market right now. It also feels more like a casino dominated by Bitcoin, than a traditional market of different assets. None of this should be surprising or particularly concerning, given the novelty of the space and lack of real-life use cases. It‚Äôs a new market with low volume, uncertain fundamentals, and little regulation. As mentioned above, the Internet era went through a similar boom-bust speculative cycle. The only difference is the speed and scale of it. The Internet era involved more money and had longer bull/bear markets. The world is different now because the Internet has opened markets globally and speed up information flow. Similar to the Internet era, there will be a rebound of those assets building real value and death to those that don‚Äôt. Over time markets mature and usage drives value, instead of speculation. So far institutional interest has been hesitant and investment has been limited to backdoor channels using small hedge funds, personal accounts, or through industry products like Bitcoin trusts and futures. The other limitation is traditional valuation models don‚Äôt apply to DLT assets like cryptocurrency and utility tokens, so pricing them is rather difficult for institutions. Simply put, traditional valuation models, regulated exchanges, and institutional products have held back the big money from investing in the space. However, that is quickly changing as reputable exchanges like the NASDAQ and ASX enter the space and new exchanges like Coinbase and Binance evolve to meet industry requirements. When considering politics, there‚Äôs a classic faceoff between centralized entities and decentralized technology over control of how the DLT space eventually blossoms. Will public blockchains win or will private blockchains? Will only centralized KYC exchanges are legal or will decentralized exchanges take root? Will taxes be enforced on every transaction or will DLT force the notion of taxes to be re-examined? How do data security laws like GDPR apply to DLT? Will anonymous cryptocurrency be outlawed? There are a variety of questions that can be asked that currently have no answers. Ultimately, it comes down to the interplay between the current power structure and the rising wave of decentralization that aims to uproot it or at the very least change it. Centralization generally comes from those already in power because the status quo currently favors them. It‚Äôs a natural instinct to protect your own power and most people do whatever they can to maintain it. Change is something that existing powers hate because it disrupts the status quo. They either resist it or try and steer it in a more favorable direction for themselves. DLT can be a very disruptive technology that uproots some of the most foundational activities in society. It can also be very complimentary to large corporations by improving their operations, saving them significant amounts of money. DLT is simply a tool and politics often determine how it‚Äôs used. Centralization has emerged in the form of permission/private blockchains that aim to privatize, patent, and keep control of networks. It‚Äôs also safer in regards to the current political landscape, given the legal and technological unknowns still present around DLT. On the other end, decentralization is pushing for public blockchains that offer new forms of free value exchange outside the traditional models. Many people don‚Äôt believe governments and big corporations have a right to syphon off value from their transactions and/or oversee their activities. Centralization is also coming in the form of crackdowns on non-KYC/AML exchanges, which herds the masses towards regulatory compliant exchanges. Powerful companies are also entering the space and looking to take over as the institutional gateway for DLT investment. On the other hand, decentralized exchanges, anonymous cryptocurrency, and smart contract protocols are laying totally new infrastructure around freedom and anonymity of economic exchange. Decentralized social media platforms, decentralized finance, and even decentralized stock exchanges in the form of STO platforms are all also emerging as replacements for some of the most powerful institutions in the world. In fact, the entire legal system is subject to revaluation as a result of DLT. Projects like OpenLaw and organizations like The Accord Project are already working on ways to make smart contracts legally binding. Political voting and government funding could one day be on the blockchain, which is radical shift many don‚Äôt see coming. In order to move the space forward from a developmental standpoint, there are technological limitations that must be overcome before mass adoption can occur. 1. Interoperability ‚Äî One of the biggest problems hindering DLT adoption is lack of interoperability. DLT not only needs to connect to other DLT, but it needs to connect with legacy systems. It‚Äôs especially crucial for smart contracts since smart contracts need external data inputs to trigger their contract logic and connection to off-chain outputs, like traditional payment systems that conduct legally compliant payments in fiat currencies. Most data needed to trigger smart contracts is stored outside their native blockchains and most people want smart contracts settlements in fiat currencies on existing systems. Smart contracts that are disconnected from the world‚Äôs data, legacy systems, and other DLT networks will be severely limited in their functionality. An API is a set of instructions (protocol) that other systems must follow if they want to interact with that specific system, such as extracting its data or utilizing its service. For example, the Uber app utilizes GPS data from a Google API, messaging functionality from the Twilio API, and payment functionality from the Stripe API. In this regard, Uber can utilize all these functions as part of their own app, instead of having to build any of those capabilities from scratch. APIs are also how other applications gets access to external data, such as an exchange using Bloomberg‚Äôs pricing data. APIs have been on a steady rise since 2005 and are quickly becoming the standard way of leveraging the data and services of another company. Due to the consensus mechanisms that underpin blockchain technology, smart contracts cannot access external data without risking the underlying security of its ledger. Oracles are a subset of DLT that facilitate the connection between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain websites and APIs. Oracles are digital agents that find and verify real-world data and cryptographically submit the information to the smart contract. They are bidirectional in that they retrieve external data and feed it into the smart contract and send data out of the smart contract and on to other systems. Today, smart contracts use centralized oracles to retrieve external data. While it does work, it raises some major concerns, mainly that a centralized Oracle becomes a central point of attack and possesses uptime vulnerabilities for the smart contract. Why go through the hassle of creating a decentralized smart contract only to have a centralized oracle feeding it data? Centralized oracles put in jeopardy the key features of decentralization, reliability, and immutability that make distributed ledgers so valuable. Chainlink is a promising project that looks primed to solve the connectivity problem by providing on-chain systems decentralized connection via oracles to any off-chain system through the use of APIs. Chainlink offers a general and flexible framework to allow on-chain contracts access to off-chain data APIs (web, IoT, GPS, cloud databases, other blockchains) and API services offered by the legacy business (SWIFT, PayPal, DocuSign, Oracle). It‚Äôs advantageous for smart contracts that need access to off-chain resources and equally enticing for legacy systems looking for new markets to sell their data and services too. The beauty of Chainlink is that developers can design their connection however they need, whether it be centralized or decentralized, open or private, and connected to an endpoint with an API. It offers high availability, flexibility in data/node aggregation, and security of data transfer through features like trusted hardware and encryption. By making the oracle process decentralized, the smart contract remains secure, reliable, and tamperproof in its end-to-end execution. There are also a variety of other interoperability blockchains focused on facilitating a decentralized connection between two DLT systems, such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Wanchain, Icon, Ark, and Aion. Another interesting project aiming to solve a separate problem for interoperability is Quant. Quant is a patented, closed source middleware (OS) that allows developers to write smart contracts in one language (MAPP), which can be deployed across any blockchain without having to rewrite the contract. The goal is to allow developers the ability to experiment and connect with many blockchains, without the risk of needing to rewrite all their code and retrain all their staff if they switch to another DLT system. Ultimately, interoperability should go a long way in solving the blockchain trilemma. Allowing seamless interoperability between chains can create chain specialization, whereas certain DLT can be optimized for certain features. For example, Ripple, Stellar or Nano may be most suited for quick micropayments, while Bitcoin is best for storing and sending large amounts of value. Another example is using EOS for smart contracts that need fast and cheap on-chain transactions, while smart contracts that need top end security can use Ethereum. Interoperability means one blockchain doesn‚Äôt have to do everything. Instead, smart contracts can leverage the different advantages of different projects according to their specific needs. 2. Scaling ‚Äî The other major hurdle that must be conquered is scaling. As stated above, interoperability can go a long way towards solving the scalability problem by allowing projects that need faster transaction speed to easily leverage scalable chains. However, scalable chains might be unfavorable for transacting large amounts of money through due to tradeoffs with security. One such solution to the problem is private and permissioned blockchains that allow fast speeds at the sake of decentralization. It looks as if many large firms will start out using permissioned systems as a risk-averse way to take advantage of DLT. On the other hand, permissionless DLT systems look primed to take over for certain use cases due to their network effects, trust maximization, and cost-effectiveness. It‚Äôs similar to today, where intranets still exist and serve a real purpose, but the Internet acts as the global gateway of communication. However, to make public DLT the standard, it will need cost-effective scaling. As mentioned above, there have been a variety of layer 2 off-chain solutions introduced to facilitate scaling, such state channels like Lighting Network and Celer, sidechains like Plasma and Liquid, and sharding protocols. There are also new blockchains (3rd generation) that have built-in parallel blockchain structures (similar to sidechains). It‚Äôs akin to every application/company having its own blockchain, which can easily communicate with other blockchains in the network, instead of one big bloated blockchain for all activity. Blockchain alternatives are also offering interesting propositions, but they will have to prove their capabilities to do so on MainNet with a high level of activity and no central coordinator. Ultimately, scaling should happen through a variety of methods. Interoperability, scaling, and layer 2 protocols will offload scaling to other DLT systems, while the underlying blockchain protocols are either upgraded or replaced by new generation blockchains and blockchain alternatives that offer better tech. The focus seems to have shifted towards having a very secure base layer, then adding layers on top of it according to market demands. It makes sense because even if on-chain scaling improves, the one blockchain for all approach seems utopian and unachievable. There is simply too much data being produced at an increasing rate and a plethora of different needs, that a multi interconnected blockchain universe built around specialization seems most practical. It can work too, as long as there is a standard for secure connectivity between networks. 3. Privacy ‚Äî Most companies have no interest in using DLT unless their transactional data is kept private. In a competitive business environment, companies cannot divulge details about their business dealings because competitors can gain valuable information from it. Also, individuals, in general, care about keeping their transactional data private. In many jurisdictions, there are data security laws that require companies to keep consumers‚Äô transactional data private. The easiest way to maintain privacy is to utilize private or permissioned blockchains. Private blockchains are the best way for companies to establish POCs in a private and secure sandbox, then spread to community blockchains and eventually on to public blockchains. Risk is heavily reduced, especially when developers and engineers are new to technology. While it does come with the downsides of the network being patented and access being restricted, it‚Äôs still the most logical first step for established institutions. They simply can‚Äôt afford data leaks and operational uncertainties that still surround public DLT. For permissionless DLT to prosper, it needs to figure out ways to maintain privacy without sacrificing other network properties. Some of the most profound research being done to solve this problem is in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs offer a way to prove an on-chain transaction happened without providing any details about the transaction, such as the sender, receiver, and amount. It‚Äôs the foundation of Zcash, a private cryptocurrency. ZKPs are improving quickly in their capabilities and will likely be one of the most important pieces of tech to solve the privacy problem of public DLT. Some interesting developments in this field, include zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKS, bulletproofs, and the Aztec Protocol. Trusted hardware, such as Intel SGX, is another major piece of technology facilitating privacy on public networks. Trusted hardware allows computer code to be run in a trusted execution environment (secure enclave), akin to it running in a black box that cannot be seen or tampered. It‚Äôs being introduced for blockchain consensus nodes through projects like Enigma and oracle nodes for projects like Chainlink. It not only brings privacy to processing and data transfer but allows more functionality, such as running code like WebAssembly (Wasm) or improving scaling through secure, low-cost off-chain processing. Finally, interoperability is another solution to privacy, since use cases requiring it can be reliably offloaded to privacy-focused DLT. 4. Governance ‚Äî Given blockchains are decentralized protocols, how does a protocol agree on innovation without centralization? Permissioned or private chains have clear governance models because the blockchain is patented and owned by a known entity. That does come with its own problems, but the pecking order is more clear. However, open source DLT has to rely on off-chain governance models or build on-chain governance directly into the base layer protocol. The most common form of governance today is off-chain governance. Bitcoin uses this approach. Improvements are proposed by its BIP proposal system, which is usually debated and voted on by the large mining pools, the core developers, and large business infrastructures like exchanges and merchant processors. While there is more decentralization, Bitcoin is slow to innovate and has been subject to hard forks. This approach is appealing since it is like direct democracy in action, but it does create community divides and increase the social attack surface of networks. It also comes with some centralization around mining (Bitmain) and development (Blockstream). Most other blockchain projects operate similar to Ethereum, where power is split between the company or foundation that controls development, miners or stakers that secure the chain and exchanges/large development companies that provide business infrastructure and investment. It‚Äôs a bit more centralized than Bitcoin since there is no voting mechanism for changes. However, people can hard fork the network if they disagree with new developments. In general, off-chain governance naturally finds some way of centralizing and is almost impossible to avoid. There is also on-chain governance, with projects such as EOS, Tezos, and Dfinity being some of the early innovators. On-chain governance allows holders to vote directly or through a representative on development proposals and even chain rewrites. While this decentralizes decision making to some degree, it is still rather centralized since voting usually requires a certain monetary stake in the network like with Tezos, or must go through a representative like in EOS. Also, chain rewrites, while handy when hacks occur, come at the expense of immutability since the state of the blockchain can be manually changed. In the end, both models should see a ton of continued development. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a clear answer because, just like in political governance, there is no perfect answer. There are only tradeoffs. On-chain and off-chain governance can both lead to centralization without the education of users. While no one wants a dictatorship, the other reality is that too much decentralization can lead to poor or stalled decision making. Most users are simply not technically literate enough to adequately vote on complex protocol changes. There are also problems of mob rule and tragedy of the commons that can occur. Blockchain governance is one of the most complicated problems in the space to solve and will likely never see a perfect solution. Chain specialization paired with interoperability should help alleviate differences by giving people choices. 5. Developer Support ‚Äî The DLT space desperately needs more developers looking at the problem. The more eyes on the code and the more brains pondering solutions to the problems, the quicker the vulnerabilities are patched and the faster innovations occur. All new technologies have a lack of talent in the beginning, but with demand comes supply. Look for education offerings in DLT to rapidly increase, as companies, both legacy, and startup, willingly spend money to train the next generation of developers. Universities and specialized classes will also compete to fill the void for opportunistic developers looking for good paying work. It‚Äôs possible that DLT developers could become one of the fastest growing careers in the market. There is also a major need for more reputable solution integrators with robust teams. Large corporations outsource complex work to integrators to reduce project risk. For example, ASX is outsourcing their redesign of CHESS to Digital Asset, who utilize Hyperledger or Microsoft/Amazon for engineering and platform support. Big companies need solution integration companies to act as 24/7 help hotlines and network specialists to guide them through their specific problems. Some companies already looking to fulfill that role include Digital Asset, Clovyr, Kaleido, and Microsoft. As stated above, one of the major problems is the lack of industry adoption for DLT. One of the areas that should spawn a vast array of use cases is interoperability. It‚Äôs akin to the Internet, specifically the world wide web, which exponentially increased the functionality of computers. There are limitless industry relevant use cases possible when smart contracts are able to connect with external data and resources. Imagine if insurance smart contracts could access IOT devices, derivatives smart contracts could access market data, and trade finance smart contracts could access events data like a Bill of lading. Additionally, what if all these smart contracts could issue payments in whatever currency desired and on whatever payment system that‚Äôs preferred? Interoperability not only gives smart contracts access to data, but legacy processes like DocuSign, SWIFT, AI algorithms in the cloud, and SaaS products like SAP. Connectivity to outside systems can and likely will start the next wave of use cases. (Example of how an oracle would facilitate a smart contract) Tokenization, ICOs, and STOs should continue their ascent as a highly attractive use cases. However, there will likely be competition from the big players, such as large exchanges like the NASDAQ and NYSE, looking to host and list such offerings. Why would these large powerful exchanges not expand their operations to include these lucrative new markets or at least buy out the first movers? Tokenization could see specialization, whereas certain blockchains specialize in tokenizing certain assets, or open platform like Ethereum could become the public registries for assets. In terms of STOs, it will be interesting to see if big exchanges take over or if startups like Polymath, Securitize, Swarm, and Own succeed. Another area that seems ripe for DLT disruption is social media. Whether people agree or not with the decision to ban and police content, the content isn‚Äôt going away. People will naturally flock to the platforms that give them a monetized voice, which is why DLT platforms like Steemit, BitTube, and DLive should see more content being hosted and digital advertising platforms like Basic Attention Token should see more browser usage. If not, other platforms will emerge, as people are starved for information in the digital age and will not put up with biased censorship. It remains to be seen what will happen with cryptocurrency. It appears Bitcoin will continue to be the Store of Value king, but in terms of being environmentally sustainable and used as a day-to-day currency, it doesn‚Äôt seem particularly well suited. There is simply no incentive to spend it since it is expensive, slow, and deflationary by nature. Most people would rather just hold it as a store of value investment. It‚Äôs still an open question whether a state channel solution like the Lightning Network can alleviate these concerns and bring micropayments to Bitcoin. Whether cryptocurrency exceeds for payments, it seems clear that new payment solutions will take root in some form. It will revolutionize the overly expensive remittance and interbank settlement industries. Something that‚Äôs likely to emerge, whether people like it or not, is government issued digital fiat. There are already many governments planning on issuing digital fiat tokens and that trend is not likely to stop. They could become the most dominant trading pairs on exchanges, essentially replacing stablecoins, or we could see stablecoins emerge based off a variety of assets. I have long argued that the best store of value is a currency based off a weighted average from a basket of assets (currencies, commodities, precious metals, stocks, etc) that is constantly updated through oracle data feeds. In this regard, no one asset is all powerful and volatility can be easily hedged through diversity. By natural adaptation alone, the base of people who widely understand DLT will grow due to increased opportunities. A certain portion of people will choose to educate themselves in a particular area if there is unearned value available. However, the reality is that the majority of the population will never know how blockchain works under the hood, just like most people have no idea how the Internet works. That‚Äôs perfectly ok because the Internet has thrived despite its highly technical nature. Highly technical fields will always leave people behind, which is why it favors those willing to learn and get involved early. While universities will offer DLT courses, companies will train DLT developers, and the diehards in crypto tech will evolve in their understandings, most people will simply miss out. The general population is generally consumers and will use technology that‚Äôs popular, such as Dapps or popular coins/tokens. Most people adopt trends because of social popularity or great use case, which often spread like wildfire on the Internet and throughout the media. Most people will not be the early adopters or early investors that shape the market. Instead of forcing education, the DLT space should focus on developing killer products to improve its overall image. While the average citizen doesn‚Äôt need to know how it works, they should have a basic understanding that DLT has a much broader value proposition than currency and pump and dump ICOs. The best way to showcase that is simply produce superior products with real world use cases of providing tangible value. Valuable technology will change the image of DLT faster and in a more positive manner than any article or video could ever possibly achieve. No one is going to take DLT seriously from an investment perspective if it continues to be so volatile. DLT exchanges desperately need more stable base pairings for crypto to trade against. While Bitcoin looks like it‚Äôs here to stay as a reliable store of value, it doesn‚Äôt make sense as a stable base pair to trade against due to its speculative value. It would behoove the market to separate itself from Bitcoin by moving most of the volume to fiat stablecoins, digital fiat, or asset-backed stablecoins. Projects shouldn‚Äôt fluctuate based off Bitcoin‚Äôs movements, which have nothing to do with their fundamental value. Hopefully investors will start valuing projects based off their unique fundamental propositions, rather than how it moves in comparison to Bitcoin. In no way should this be forced, but without a decoupling from Bitcoin, other crypto-assets can‚Äôt properly find their value. Bitcoin could become a valuable base pair in the future, but in its infant stages of price discovery, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. Volatility in crypto-assets in general is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Volatility in natural to infant markets when speculation is rampant due to its uncertain direction. There are no well-developed DLT networks to study yet, maybe outside BTC, so gathering reliable data is tough. Stability comes from mature networks with real use cases and real adoption. So in this regard, it‚Äôs hard to see adoption when the market is volatile, but the market is volatile because there is little adoption. It will be interesting to see how this problem is solved. Allowing crypto-assets to separate from externalities, like Bitcoin volatility, should help researchers improve the underdeveloped crypto-economic models for valuing cryptocurrency and utility tokens. Some interesting questions in this regard are how utility tokens will be valued compared to store of value coins? Will the velocity of utility token usage keep prices low? Will staking mechanisms provide higher returns due to a majority of tokens being out of circulation? There are also some hybrid models like Chainlink, which combine utility for usage mixed with staking for protocol-level insurance on data feeds. Many questions have yet to be answered in this department and ultimately can‚Äôt until networks are more mature. Separation from Bitcoin and stable base trading pairs should allow institutional money to start coming into DLT with more reliability. While people might think institutional money is not needed, the reality is that the current crypto market as a whole is smaller than most large pension funds. The DLT space is a drop in the bucket in terms of valuation compared to the institutional money looking for new investment vehicles. Their appetite from DLT investment could only increase too, if the stock, real estate, and bond markets slow down from their extended bull run. In general, the DLT space should see a variety of new institutional infrastructure emerge, whether it be custodial services, institutional exchanges, and easy to use wallets and user interfaces that take away the complexity. It‚Äôs not just about better infrastructure, but better products like Crypto Indexes, ETFs, STOs, and an expanded futures and options market. Look for there to be heavy competition between large brokerage houses in offering the best institutional products for DLT exposure. In fact, it is already starting. Although most have not launched yet, there are a variety of announced institutional products coming to the market. Such products include: The battle over control of the crypto space will likely not produce anyone winner, but instead a market of options. If a company wants more privacy and control, but less trust, then they may go with a private DLT. However, if someone wants full trust, but slightly less speed, then they could use public DLT. There shouldn‚Äôt be a one size fits all approach, but a multitude of approaches that suit people‚Äôs particular needs. It also shouldn‚Äôt be a private vs. public debate, where the market has to chose one or the other. Companies can leverage different approaches for different use cases. Public and private networks can also communicate with one another through interoperability solutions like Chainlink, Quant, and Polkadot. Governments will continue trying to get control the space and exchanges will likely be the choke point. Without truly decentralized exchanges or decentralized protocols run by masternodes or miners, there is really no free flow of value without surveillance and extensive regulation. At the same time, the lack of regulation has turned the DLT space into a manipulative market controlled by various power players. Some regulations to extinguish shady exchanges, hold ICOs accountable, and clean up rules around taxation would help the space legitimize the industry to many investors. However, would governments regulate in a way that benefits the ideals of the space or in a way that caters to their own self-interests? There are a variety of other questions that need to be answered. Such questions include: will there be universal standards for DLT? How will data security laws, such as company requirements to store data in specific geographic location, interact with borderless DLT? Will crypto-assets be taxed on a transactional basis? Who has jurisdiction over crypto-assets? Will digital identity laws reshape Big Data applications? Will sophisticated investor laws be dropped to open up venture capital to the entire population? Will smart contracts be legally enforceable? The list could on, but it‚Äôs safe to say that the political situation is far from over and really just beginning. It‚Äôs not just DLT that‚Äôs pushing new political conversations, but all the technologies surrounding the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as AI, IoT, Biotechnology, 3D Printing, open-source technology, autonomous vehicles, robotics, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and open APIs (like PSD2), among others. Society is heading towards a convergence of DLT and politics that will shape the future landscape of value exchange for decades to come. Money, record keeping, and trusted third parties birthed markets, the Internet took markets globally, and DLT can upgrade the global infrastructure to make it real time, secure, and seamless. DLT can alleviate much of the friction that currently exists when exchanging value between two entities. It takes away the need to trust people and replaces it with trust in open source computer software that anyone can verify as accurate, but nobody can control or tamper. Value slippage during exchange can and should be a thing of the past. It‚Äôs imperative that regulations do not overreach in an effort to maintain control, or else society may never see the full benefits of decentralization. On the other end, it‚Äôs vital that those working towards decentralization do so with honor, logic, and ethics. Selfish, reckless, and utopian stewardship of the move towards decentralization will only bring negative backlash and unrealistic expectations. DLT won‚Äôt bring a perfect world, but it can be vastly improved to the benefit of everyone. Technology is simply a tool and how we use it is often a combination of our collective philosophy, ethics, and political will. It might not seem that grandiose right now, but DLT is a foundational technology that can get rid of the centralized chokepoints holding back mass value exchange and equitable monetization on a global level not seen before. Shaping it to the benefit of all mankind and not just a few people is of the utmost importance. The technology is bound to advance, but the question remains. What will the current generation do with the immense power of DLT? Let‚Äôs not squander this amazing opportunity.

https://medium.com/@Sandra_Kpodar/are-you-trying-to-build-diverse-teams-d75c9f8a14a6?source=tag_archive---------72-----------------------,Are you trying to build diverse teams?,"If so, allies, what matters most and what‚Äôs being left out?",Sandra Kpodar,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sandra Kpodar Follow -- Listen Share Cet article est √©galement disponible en fran√ßais. After navigating and experiencing the design field for 2 years as well as reading countless posts about diversity and inclusion mostly in two countries (UK and France), I feel compelled to ask questions and share my perspective on what I think is missing in the conversation. I‚Äôm also very aware of the value that a conversation can have for professional development and I‚Äôm also grateful for the people who have taken the time to answer my questions and share their experience along the way. A network audit will reveal who you tend to interact with most. This activity will also show you who you tend to respond to most. While you do not owe an interaction to anyone in particular, it‚Äôs one of the small things you could do to go beyond your network. Are you connecting and engaging with people that you are used to or are you open to having conversations with new people (whether they be new to the field or established)? These conversations may not seem necessary or possible, but if you are committed to bringing talents and new voices to your organisation, be open to them. This is in spite of the fact that these conversations might get uncomfortable. Perspectives and experiences will differ and unless we listen without trying to explain or justify what we are being told, it will be difficult to find common ground to work on challenges together. Echo chambers will not lead to new ways of addressing them. None of us exists in a vacuum. What are the systemic blockers that prevent you from building a team of diverse talents? Only you can answer that if you take the time to review your ecosystem and the stakeholders involved with your organisation. If you are not familiar with it, consider reading the study run by Dolly Chugh and her colleagues. What Prof. Chugh and her colleagues noted was: ‚ÄúGateways are the entry points into valued organizations, communities, or institutions, whereas pathways describe the more fluid processes that influence one‚Äôs ability to access an entry point and succeed after entry (Chugh & Brief, 2008). Positive outcomes along pathways and at gateways can determine success in organizations.‚Äù Ask yourself: Who makes it past your gateways? Who gets positive outcomes along pathways? Answers to these questions will be specific to your company and will require zooming out to get a systemic view. It may also require partnerships with other organisations to minimise blind spots. As recruiters or hiring managers, you cannot look at the challenge solely from an organisational level. As an organisation, what are your standards? More specifically, how do you communicate your standards for inclusion to your employees and the rest of your industry? What do they translate into in practical terms? If inclusion is part of your values, have you built an organisation which translates inclusion, transparency and accountability into clear policies? Openness and accountability do not appear to be optional especially when teams that create products and/or services do not always reflect the users they are targeting. When talking about a fit are you looking for a values-fit or a job fit? What is talent to you? How do you translate that into requirements? Depending on their mental models your team members may have differing views on these questions especially when it comes to helping make hiring decisions. What you give time to, you give importance to. Are you prepared to dedicate some time to it? Your answer to this will be personal and if it is no. It‚Äôs a no. However, building a team of people bringing diverse perspectives means that we should all be involved in Diversity & Inclusion initiatives (this goes beyond stages, and posts on social media). We all need to figure out how much time we could dedicate to it. For you this may mean considering doing this from the bottom to the top of your organisation. If not, could you find a way to share small requests with your network or a FAQ page that potential applicants could access? If you cannot dedicate time to making your team more diverse in experience and thought, could you find a way to share small requests from potential applicants with your network or to redirect them to relevant organisations? It might be a small and rudimentary suggestion but it is one of the small ways we could make the needle move to bring about systemic change. Systemic change cannot happen if we do not all get involved and make small changes to the way we work, hire, review, and support others. It cannot happen if we do not start small either. Launching big initiatives (e.g. mentoring schemes, work shadowing opportunities etc) to have an impact is better than inaction, but what‚Äôs missing in this conversation is the fact that even with the best intentions to make these work, behaviours are shaped by personal beliefs and systemic beliefs may be difficult to challenge. In addition to that, systemic behaviour change is no easy task. By all means, keep talking about what can be done and go further by questioning what‚Äôs being done or speaking up about what‚Äôs being left unsaid when it comes to hiring, team dynamics and bias but let‚Äôs not avoid these difficult conversations. Change requires organisational leaders who recognise bias as bias and are willing to take action against it through inclusive policies and the creation of supportive work environments. ‚Äî Benjamin Kessler, Clarissa Cortland, Zoe Kinias, INSEAD However uncomfortable the conversations around diversity and inclusion at work may be, designing inclusive and sustainable products and services will require teams made of people with different skillsets, strengths, and perspectives. Words that aren‚Äôt matched by concrete actions are just as unhelpful as inaction. Teaching others, developing them to pass on practices that are evidence-based and having an impact is what we should be aiming for. The work that Atlassian does opens up these opportunities to see and share what could be done. When it comes to education, whether it be provided by educational organisations or private companies, let‚Äôs ensure that the needs of all students are met. By that I mean, are these organisations able to be audited and evaluated in terms of learning outcomes? What is their curriculum and what are the standards expected? Paying for a service or a course may not guarantee anything. Yet attention should be paid to these because they have a direct impact on whether individuals (especially those from underrepresented groups) are equipped with the skills, experience and knowledge they need to secure job opportunities. Looking into this, I realised that there are differences between what‚Äôs going on in the US and UK and in France. What are the implications? This means that approaches to diversity and inclusion in France won‚Äôt look the same partly because of the concept of ‚ÄúFrench integration‚Äù which disregards differences between individuals; French law also forbids the collection of racial statistics among other characteristics ‚Äî there are some exceptions to the law though. However, I did come across a project Team Jolokia which involved a sailing team made of people of different genders, backgrounds, and abilities. Their performance was tested over time and it turns out that they have consistently performed highly in competitions. Initiatives like Diversidays promote diverse talents in tech. Gender parity seems to be a focus and you will find organisations like Girlz in Web, Women In Tech actively working on that (both have HQs in Paris). There is also an event coming up at Station F in Paris: F for femme. It is aimed at female founders. Depending on your location which may not be in any of these three countries(US, UK, or France), you may have a different definition of D&I. Do share what it‚Äôs like in your country and whether there are initiatives in place in your organisation. What I‚Äôm getting at with this is that building diverse teams will require an awareness that local culture may mean that diversity and inclusion will look different and mean different things to different people if they think about it at all. In a global world of work where a lot of content on diversity and inclusion is in English, it‚Äôs also worth being open to testing approaches and adapting them to your context. If we step back to look at what we can do at our level from the smallest act to bigger initiatives, we stand a chance of addressing challenges currently affecting our organisations and the industry at large. Project Include is another initiative which is highlighting what can be done within organisations. Better Allies and Hustle Crew are also worth looking into when it comes to matching words with concrete actions. Where there is a will, there is a way. Are you willing to have conversations with people that may not agree with you to move things forward? I will include below some further reading and resources that have informed this piece. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as an all-in-one, scalable, lasting solution that can be designed to achieve workplace inclusion, according to Joelle Emerson, founder and CEO of Paradigm.‚Äù Many thanks for their feedback to: Harry, Karen, Minda, Emma, Josh, Vala and Alison. -- -- Sandra is interested in all things to do with tech, learning, design and diversity and inclusion Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*ynisAd7wVsSfzFge4QUF8w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ynisAd7wVsSfzFge4QUF8w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ynisAd7wVsSfzFge4QUF8w.png"

How to create Backlink¬†: Blog commenting is the most commonly used method for building backlinks to your website. Actually, it has been used and abused in the past so much that most blogs and search engines have completely discounted the value of comment links in terms of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) value. Many blogs do not link out. Most have the nofollow attribute applied to comments and a great number of bloggers have turned off commenting all together.Still, however, commenting on blogs can have great value if a blog visitor uses it for what it was intended for, as a means to encourage dialogue and idea exchange. Here are some steps that will help you to get your comments approved if you are a blogger or webmaster looking to comment so as to drive traffic and grow your indexed backlink count.Find The Right Blogs. What good is commenting on a blog that doesn‚Äôt teach you about your niche or is not related to you niche in a direct or supplemental way. The purpose of commenting on blogs is to interact with both the blogger and their visitors. If you have a website about a certain subject, find blog about that same subject or related subjects. By doing so, odds are you will find targeted, search-engine-driven traffic consisting of like-minded surfers looking to learn and interact.

https://medium.com/@BennettGarner/developers-your-poorly-named-variables-are-hurting-your-team-a8ec31e3cbd5?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,Developers: Your Poorly Named Variables Are Hurting Your Team,Written by Bennett Garner,Bennett Garner,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bennett Garner Follow -- Listen Share If you‚Äôre a developer that always uses the first variable name that comes to mind, you‚Äôre probably making your code hard to read, use, and maintain. As developers, we‚Äôre constantly naming things. Variables, functions, classes, and modules all need names. You likely don‚Äôt think about it, but a major portion of a developer‚Äôs workflow is choosing and using names for abstractions. For example, I just looked through a ~100 line twitter bot application I wrote. Even in this relatively small program, I found 40 unique names for variables, functions, classes, and methods. Of those forty names, twenty-three were names somebody else came up with that I had to learn (Tweepy, tqdm modules). The remaining seventeen were all names I created in just 100 lines of code! (Not all the names are perfect, either ‚Äî if you notice something I should change, send me a pull request.) Since names are so ubiquitous in software development, getting good at naming is a critical skill for every developer. It is foundational to what we do, and the code we write will include hundreds or thousands of names for things. When you name things in a vague or confusing way, the code takes more time and effort to read. Other developers who work on your code (or even your future self) will scratch their heads wondering what that method does and why you chose to name a variable a1. When you name things clearly, on the other hand, the code becomes readable. When a developer needs to add new code its obvious what each variable stores and what each function does from the names themselves. Good naming is good coding. It‚Äôs fast to write, understandable to read, and easy to talk about. Hopefully I‚Äôve convinced you that naming is important. In this guide, I‚Äôll share the best practices for naming things. Of course, there are opinions and variations on these rules, so my word is not law. It is, however, a good starting point and backed up by reading books like Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer. For some reason, many developers are scared of longer names for things. So, they abbreviate or create pseudonyms for long words. Something like this isn‚Äôt too uncommon: Of course, dis shorter and smaller on the screen, but is it really easier to use than a variable named distanceInFeet? Every use of dtakes a mental effort to remember what dstands for. This gets even more taxing when the application grows to require some measurement of time. Now, developers will have to do a double take to remember if `d` stands for ‚Äúdistance‚Äù or ‚Äúdays‚Äù. The only exception I can think of to the rule against abbreviations and single character names is the convention of using i / j / kas iterators in for loops. All developers know these iterators, so using them isn‚Äôt a mental burden in the same way. If you‚Äôre using any decent code editing tool like Sublime, Atom, Vim, Emacs, or Visual Studio, then code completion should be built in or you can add it as a plugin. This means that typing time and misspellings aren‚Äôt really a valid objection to longer names. Once you‚Äôve defined the variable or function, your editor will remember the name for you and type it flawlessly with a few keystrokes. Just because a name is long doesn‚Äôt make it good. While you shouldn‚Äôt be scared to use longer names, use that extra space only for a good purpose. Don‚Äôt bloat your names or add unneeded fillers. Something like is 2/3 redundant. Any developer can tell that‚Äôs a list just by looking at it. No need to include ‚Äúlist‚Äù in the variable name, then. Instead, just calling the variable usersworks well enough. Similarly, calling a variable time_amount isn‚Äôt meaningfully different from calling it time. If you need two variables for time, use the name to tell what sets them apart. Don‚Äôt just make them variations on one another. For example, using time_1 and time_2 would be just as bad because it doesn‚Äôt give any context. Instead, perhaps start_time and stop_time are a little better. start_time_utc might be even better, depending on the context. For example, good variable names (depending on the context) might be unregisteredUsers, itemsOnSale, or countOfAccounts. Good function names might be getUserBalance(), setItemPrice(), or isRegistered(). The key to making simple names like this is to actually keep your functions simple. If a function has to do many things, it‚Äôs going to be hard to come up with a simple name for it. However, when each function does only one thing, naming and calling functions gets much easier. The same goes for classes. When they start to get unruly, that‚Äôs a smell that you need to separate them out and nest them together in simpler component pieces. That said, you should spend some time thinking about your names. A name should make it clear what you‚Äôll get when you call it. If I see a variable called users, I expect a list. If it‚Äôs an integer count of the number of currently logged in users, then the name should be userCount, countOnlineUsers, or similar. Sometimes synonyms get mixed up in your naming, leading to confusion. Was that method named .addUser() or .createUser()? Why do I .removeUser()but I .deleteAccount? Consistency in naming is critical, especially as your application grows. You should use only one word per concept in your naming scheme. For example, decide early on if you‚Äôre going to use getor fetchin your function names. Will it be set, put, or update? For variables and classes, use the words specific to your problem domain and stick to a certain set. Decide if it‚Äôs a cartor a basket, a likeor a favorite, a messageor a chat. This post has only covered the basic principles of good naming. But if you follow the guidelines outlined here, you‚Äôll be writing more readable code than many developers out there. Your employer and teammates will have their own preferences and conventions about naming, and you should learn from them. However, don‚Äôt be shy to stand up for the code and point out bad names when they arise. The longer you leave a bad name, the more likely it is to get baked into the system and the harder it becomes to change. Did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments below!

Not without reason LXD is one of the most important features of Ubuntu Server for me. There are many ways to access a web application in an LXD container from outside. For example, you can use a reverse proxy to control access to the containers. Another possibility is to set up a network bridge so that the containers are in the same network as the container host (the Ubuntu server). In this article I would like to describe how to set up a network bridge for LXD containers. To set up a network bridge under Ubuntu, you need to install the bridge-utils: Then you can set up the network bridge. Up to Ubuntu 16.04 Ubuntu uses ifupdown to set network connection settings. The configuration is done in the files under /etc/network/. A simple network bridge ‚Äî to get the containers into the host network ‚Äî might look like this: In this example the bridge gets its address from a DHCP server. The real network card enp4s0 is set to manual mode and assigned to the bridge. As of Ubuntu 18.04 Netplan is used to configure the network connections. The configuration files can be found under /etc/netplan/. A definition for the bridge could look like this: In the upper part you configure the real network card (enp3s0) and don‚Äôt assign an address to it. Then the definition of the network bridge follows. It is set up like a static network connection and also contains the key interfaces. There you define which real network card should be ‚Äúbridged‚Äù. You will find further (more complex) examples of network bridges on the official website. Now the following command applies the changes to the network settings: Once you have finished setting up the network bridge and it gets the correct IP address, you have to tell the LXD container to get its IP address from the network bridge. This can be done with the following command: With name=eth0 you define under which name the network card can be found in the container. Now you can configure eth0 in the container as you like. From now on the container will get an IP address from the host network. You can set up a simple network bridge quit easily and assign it to a container. This allows other users on the network to access a web application without the need to set up a reverse proxy on the container host. More complex scenarios are also possible (VLANs, multiple bridges to get containers into different networks, etc.), but this would go beyond the scope of this short article.

No. We dug through the S1‚Äôs of 122 tech companies and found that only 22 of them had a strategic investor (an S1 is a doc filed with the SEC before going public). The list is below. Notably, some industries have more prevalence of strategic investment than others. For instance, three out of the eight hardware companies we looked at had a strategic investor whereas industries like marketplaces, social media, and e-commerce barely had any. All the companies listed above are very successful as they‚Äôre all publicly traded today or were at one point, so we‚Äôve concluded you do not need a strategic investor to be successful given that only 18% had a strategic. Some of the companies in our own portfolio have strategic investors such as Match.com, GE, Cisco, Salesforce, the CIA, and Survey Monkey. What we‚Äôve found is that in most cases, strategics don‚Äôt add much value. Rather, they‚Äôve invested because they think the company is interesting and want to be in a position to acquire it if the company shows great potential. In other cases (GE and Cisco for instance), they‚Äôve invested because they‚Äôre heavy users of the product and want to make it better (in which case they‚Äôre very valuable). If you are going to take on a strategic investor, make sure they don‚Äôt have any unique controls or rights outside of those granted to normal investors. For instance, some strategics will ask for a Right of First Refusal to buy your company, which can be very damaging when it‚Äôs time to sell your business; no one will want to buy you if they know that after all their hard work, XYZ strategic can cancel the deal and buy your company themselves. Also make sure that startegics do not have control over the direction of your product; it‚Äôs great to take their advice when that advice fits into the road map, but an investment doesn‚Äôt give them the right to mandate what you build. As always choose your investors wisely, but don‚Äôt fret if the strategics aren‚Äôt a part of your business.

It‚Äôs so well designed. And this past week, when we were without power due to PG&E‚Äôs horrible performance, guess what? It worked! It‚Äôs been an awful few weeks for the disgraced utility. It botched communication during the first blackout, announcing it while management was partying at a three-star Michelin in Napa Valley. They next cut power to millions of customers across many counties, only to forget to turn off a 230,000-volt transmission line that ‚Äî guess what ‚Äî started a major fire! It turned off 30,000 miles of lines that couldn‚Äôt be turned back on until ‚Äî guess what ‚Äî they were inspected by humans in helicopters and on the ground. They told us it could take five days to manually inspect the lines and to prepare for a longer outage. Then they failed to realize (or if they did, didn‚Äôt care) that cell phone towers would be without power, and with so many people having only cell phones these days ‚Äî guess what ‚Äî they couldn‚Äôt get updates from PG&E. Couldn‚Äôt get in touch with friends and family. Couldn‚Äôt make a call in an emergency and couldn‚Äôt tell if more fires were coming because they couldn‚Äôt receive notifications. PG&E spokespeople had the audacity to say ‚Äúuse a landline.‚Äù Out of touch or what? Some of us are old school. We‚Äôre not on Facebook and never have been. We still take notes on paper. We still write letters and use wonderful pens from Italy. And we have Trimline phones. Ours worked, thank gosh. We were two days without power, and it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. We could call our family. We lit our gas stove by hand but managed to cook. We figured out how to keep coolers filled with ice so our food didn‚Äôt spoil. We figured out that water warmed on the stove could suffice for a sponge bath, or washing our hair with cold water wasn‚Äôt the end of the world at all. We had fires in the fireplace and our homes were standing. But it‚Äôs time to put technology to better use. I wondered why PG&E wasn‚Äôt using drones to inspect lines but then read this week that the Interior Department grounded its fleet of them because of security risks with China. Can‚Äôt we make our own drones? It wasn‚Äôt a good week for PG&E, and for technology, really. Facebook continues with its political ads unrepentant and caring less about Twitter‚Äôs strong stance. Boeing still can‚Äôt get its act together with the MAX. Studies showed US students continue to decline in test scores in nearly all categories. So, I say, so much for EdTech and the gazillions of venture capital dollars trying to make things better. Apple‚Äôs figuring out its place in the streaming TV service world. And despite billions poured into a new tech-laden stadium, my beloved Warriors face catastrophic injury after injury, becoming an unrecognizable shadow of themselves. Alas, when we get enamored with the next big thing, we have to remember that sometimes no tech or low tech gets the job done. Guess what?

This is part of a series of Q&A with people from a wide range of disciplines and expertise that challenges them to think about what they would put in a metaphorical ‚Äúcommunity-in-a-box‚Äù to help kick-start an extraterrestrial community, and why. I‚Äôm a professor in the Arizona State University School for the Future of Innovation in Society, Director of the ASU Risk Innovation Lab, and author of Films from the Future: The Technology and Morality of Sci-Fi Movies. I‚Äôm also a member of the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Agile Governance, and a contributor to the Forum‚Äôs annual review of top ten emerging technologies. In my work I focus on technological convergence and socially responsible innovation, and write extensively on risks and benefits of technologies ranging from nanotechnology and synthetic biology, to artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. I was previously chair of the Environmental Health Sciences Department at the University of Michigan, and I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1992 with a PhD in physics. There are some critical aspects of Earth-bound communities that have caused them to succeed or fail. In no particular order (and in the recognition that the list isn‚Äôt inclusive), these include how to develop and use an agreed-on set of values, standards and norms; how to develop and implement codified rules and guidelines for how things are done; how to ensure that disruptive and antisocial behavior does not jeopardize the community; how to develop processes and cultures can adapt to changing circumstances; how to generate and use new knowledge effectively; how to create a social ecosystem within which individuals and communities can find meaning; and how to leverage the curiosity, creativity and imagination of people to build a vibrant and thriving community. Some of these are likely to have greater or lesser importance at different stages of community building. However, ignoring any of them is likely to sow the seeds of dysfunction. My work focuses predominantly on emerging technologies and socially responsible innovation, with an emphasis on understanding and navigating novel risks. Based on what we see from the complex dynamic between society and technology on Earth, the successful and sustainable development and use of new technologies is critically dependent on perspectives and understanding that transcends traditional disciplines. This is especially seen in how often ideas that seem to make sense from a purely scientific or technological perspective fail because social, economic and political factors. In fact, we‚Äôre increasingly referring to these factors as ‚Äúorphan risks,‚Äù meaning that they are too-often overlooked or ignored, and yet can mean the difference between success and failure. Despite most (not all) of my work being Earth-bound, there are vital insights that it provides for building vibrant and sustainable off-world communities. Not least is the danger of assuming that sustainable communities can be based on scientific and technological knowhow and leadership, and little else. The reality is that the long-term success of any community depends on an ability to look beyond the constraints of specific disciplines or limited world views, and draws on insights from a broad tapestry of perspectives and insights. And nowhere is this more important than when it comes to the ‚Äúorphan risks‚Äù of not understanding or appreciating human behavior and nature. Imagine a scenario where 100 people are going to another planetary body in our solar system (e.g. Mars, or the Moon). Now imagine they are taking a ‚Äúbox‚Äù with them that contains all the knowledge they will need to build a vibrant and sustainable community ‚Äî a kick-starter ‚ÄúCommunity-in-a-Box‚Äù.

https://medium.com/hacksters-blog/this-baseball-will-change-course-in-midair-using-a-built-in-jet-470f0a0cf5be?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,This Baseball Will Change Course in Midair Using a Built-In Jet,Written by Cameron Coward,Cameron Coward,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cameron Coward Follow -- Listen Share In baseball, the pitcher‚Äôs job is to throw the ball in such a way that the batter can physically hit it, but is unable to. The ball has to pass through an imaginary window that the better can reach, but that‚Äôs the only real rule. So pitchers utilize a number of different techniques to make the ball more difficult to hit. That can be a simple as throwing it really fast, or as tricky as spinning the ball so it curves in the air. This baseball, however, can change its own trajectory in midair using a jet of compressed gas to fool the batter. This ‚ÄúFart Ball‚Äù was designed and built by a Japanese man who guys by the username Human Controller, and who also created the amazing self-solving Rubik‚Äôs cube that we featured last year. Just like with that project, this Fart Ball is an everyday item that has been reinvented using technology. There is a small tank of compressed gas inside of the baseball, and that can be released through a outlet port to change the course of the ball while its soaring through the air. The pitcher holds a remote to trigger the gas jet, so they can fire it at the optimal time to trick the batter. It was built by cutting open a standard baseball and removing everything inside. Then a 3D-printed frame was inserted into the skin that holds all of the components. Those include the compressed gas tank salvaged from an airsoft-style toy gun, a solenoid to open the valve on the tank, electrolytic capacitors to energize the solenoid, a wireless remote module, and a CR2032 battery to power that module. The remote has its own wireless remote module and battery. The 3D-printed frame is surrounded by gel tape to keep it in place and to absorb shocks. As you can see in the video, it does a very good job of changing course unpredictably ‚Äî though it probably violates MLB rules. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"
https://medium.com/@Evonodes/the-importance-of-choosing-a-masternode-hosting-service-93a613022a54?source=tag_archive---------94-----------------------,The Importance of Choosing a Masternode Hosting Service,Written by EvoNodes,EvoNodes,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in EvoNodes Follow -- Listen Share Choosing which masternode hosting services to list with is a very important task, for new coins and mature coins alike. While they all achieve the same goal of hosting masternodes, each service goes about it a little differently, and these small differences can make a world of a difference in your overall satisfaction with the service. Not to mention the masternode hosting space is becoming quite crowded and choosing which service/s to list your coin on may seem like a daunting task. In this article I hope to showcase the important aspects and features of a masternode hosting service, including what to expect, what to look for and what to avoid. First I will say that the content within this article is my own personal opinion. Second, I would like to attempt to debunk the myth that a masternode hosting service should be expected to guarantee, or be chosen over another platform based on, exposure for the coin that is being listing. Nor should our listing fees be judged or gauged by such criteria. We are crypto custodial services, not marketing services. Any exposure gained via listing with a masternode hosting service should be considered a bonus. Instead focus should be pointed towards far more important aspects such as security, platform features, quality of service, and quality of customer support. First and foremost, security. Security is absolutely priceless! One should ask many questions about what types of security measures are in place to protect their investor‚Äôs funds. It certainly will not look good, especially for a new coin, to list with a service that has less than adequate security measures in place. Cold Wallet storage is a MUST! I encourage you to take a look at this article, where our team at Evonodes provides a deep explanation of the security measures we have in place.https://medium.com/@smokeysrh/evonodes-weekly-3-21-19-6825c9f9e9b4 One major ‚Äúfeature‚Äù to avoid is Instant Withdraws. Instant withdraws require coins to be stored in Hot Wallets. Hot wallets are open to the network and have a considerably higher chance of being hacked. Take for example the recent Binance Hack. Binance is one of, (if not THE), largest exchanges in the world, and they had 7000 BTC ($40 million) stolen from their hot wallets! Now this isn‚Äôt to say that a masternode hosting platform is similar to that of Binance‚Äôs platform. BUT, it does drive home the point that hot wallets are not a safe place to store coins. Although, for an exchange some coins need to be in hot wallets in order for trading to take place, this isn‚Äôt necessary for a masternode hosting service unless they are providing Instant Withdraws. Even though Instant withdraws seem like an attractive feature, they are actually not worth the risk in my opinion. So I will repeat, Cold Wallet storage is a MUST for a masternode hosting service! Next I want to talk about Customer Service. Since I have been in the Service Industry for most of my life, I tend to place customer service high on my list. Others may have differing opinions, but to me, nothing can compare to a great customer service experience. Not only for the project investors, but for the development team as well. Sure most masternode hosting services provide decent customer service to the investors using their platform, but all to often the development teams behind the projects are not given that same level of service and respect, or even worse they get taken advantage of. Make sure to ask around, get some feedback on the teams behind the platforms you are interested in listing on. I see plenty of teams asking their communities which services they like the most, which is great, but I would encourage you to also ask the teams behind other coins where they have had their best experiences at. Always ask if there are any hidden or known fees for wallet updates/hard forks/ect. Finding out about these things down the road can really hinder or even halt progress for your project. Next let‚Äôs talk about platform features. This will be different for each person, depending on what features are important to you and your community. Some things to consider are withdraw/deposit times. Is the platform easy to use? Do they offer Instant Shares? Are there any collateral locks? Do they have auto-reinvestment? If it is a Shared Masternode hosting service like Evonodes, are there seats, reservations, minimum deposits/staking amounts, or any long waits to get in or out of a node? The space is constantly evolving and new features are coming out all the time. Which of the platforms that you are looking at are the ones that are working hard, creating these new features, and which are merely following the trend? Lastly, we will discuss fees. One of the biggest things to consider when choosing a masternode hosting service, is the fee charged to host the masternodes. This will take a bit of math to figure out, but the best way to compare this is to look at how much is charged per full masternode per month. Each service takes their fees, & displays their fees, in different ways. Some use percentages, others us a flat dollar amount. Some take fees from the masternode rewards, others take fiat only. When comparing fees, remember to take into consideration everything we have discussed thus far, and keep in mind that you get what you pay for. You want to make sure that you aren‚Äôt picking the bargain basement deals, but at the same time you want to make sure you aren‚Äôt choosing a service that is going to charge outrageous and unfair hosting fees. The investors of your project will need great service at a fair price. It is up to you to seek out that balance. To close out this article I would like to drive home the overall message I am trying to put out there, and that is to DO RESEARCH! Whether you list on our platform EvoNodes, or one of our competitors, make sure your investors and the safety of their coins are top priority. If you do that, you will increase the chances of success for your project immensely. With that said, on behalf of the team at EvoNodes, best wishes in all that you do, and may your successes see no boundaries or limitations!

Cook,Jeremy S. Cook,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- 1 Listen Share When working with rotating or otherwise dangerous equipment, you should wear eye protection. For some ‚Äî hopefully most ‚Äî it‚Äôs second nature to reach for your forehead when you‚Äôre about to go into ‚Äúthe danger zone.‚Äù For others though, the excitement of building something takes over, and you might forget to drop the shades, or ‚Äúwrap-around clears‚Äù to be more accurate. This was G√∂rkem Bozkurt‚Äôs problem until quite recently, when he designed the ‚ÄúEye Guardian‚Äù hat. This baseball cap has a rather unusual augmentation, in the form of an Arduino Nano, a MAX4466 microphone module, a 9V battery, and a servo. This allows it to drop a pair of safety glasses, also mounted on the hat, into place when sound levels go past a certain level. The idea is that when the Arduino/microphone hears a loud sound, this implies the use of power tools, and thus danger. It then retracts the glasses when the sound is low enough, purportedly meaning that the danger is gone. While the design would likely not fulfill OSHA standards, Bozkurt is quick to note that the design is a work-in-progress, and invites anyone with improvement ideas to chime in on his write-up. Regardless, it‚Äôs a very entertaining project, seen in the demo video below. On a related note, don‚Äôt ever take chances with your eyes. You might suppose that ‚Äúwell I can just do this one cut/drill/weld/whatever,‚Äù but that one time can be the time something goes wrong, just as easily as any other. Practically speaking, it can even be helpful to have a couple pairs around in case one or two get temporarily misplaced, or you have guests in your shop. -- -- 1 New Posts on Substack: https://techadjacent.substack.com/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg"

One of the most popular dApps, cryptokitties, is a collectibles-style game built on Ethereum. When we build a game with Ethereum each game action and transaction is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain, and other blockchain platforms. TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, which basically means that every DApp run on Ethereum can be easily ported to TomoChain. For more information about TomoChain, please refer to our website. Cocos Creator is a complete package of game development tools and workflow, including a game engine (based on Cocos2d-x), resource management, scene editing, game preview, and debug and publish from one project to multiple platforms. For the first time we introduced entity-component structure and data-driven workflow to the Cocos2d-x family. With JavaScript, you can script your component in no time. The editor and engine extension is also made with JavaScript so you can make games and refine your tools in a single programming language. Cocos Creator provides an innovative, and easy to use toolset such as the UI system and Animation editor. The toolset will be expanding continuously and quickly, thanks to the open editor extension system. Homepage: https://cocos2d-x.org/creator Docs: https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/manual/en/ For this tutorial, we will make a simple game dApp called ‚ÄúTomo Lucky Box‚Äù using Cocos Creator. Gameplay: We have 3 boxes to choose. We need to pay 1 TOMO each time we open one box, if you choose the lucky box you will get a prize. We recommend you have a basic understanding of: You will need a wallet address and some tokens. We will show you how to do it on both TomoChain Testnet and Mainnet. You can create a new TOMO wallet using TomoWallet mobile app for Android or iOS. Under Settings go to Advanced Settings, here you can Choose network and select TomoChain TestNet or TomoChain MainNet. Go to Settings menu, select Backup wallet and then Continue. Here you can see your wallet‚Äôs private key and the 12-word recovery phrase. Write down the 12-word recovery phrase. You can also create a new TomoChain wallet with MetaMask, MyEtherWallet or TrustWallet. For instance, for mainnet you can go to MyEtherWallet and select TOMO (tomochain.com) on the top right corner. Enter a password and then Create a new wallet. Write down your recovery phrase. For this tutorial, the wallet address (testnet) is: 0xc9b694877acd4e2e100e095788a591249c38b9c5 The recovery phrase (12-word mnemonic) is: myth ahead spin horn minute tag spirit please gospel infant clog camera Write them down. This will be needed later. Notice that your wallet address (public key) and your recovery phrase will be different than mine. Important! Always keep your private key and recovery phrase secret! Tokens are required for different matters, like smart contract deployment or to use in DApps. Testnet: Receive 15 free testnet TOMO tokens using TomoChain‚Äôs Faucet. Mainnet: You need real TOMO from exchanges. Go to faucet and collect 30 TOMO. Now your wallet has enough balance to do everything in this tutorial so‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs go ahead! To check the balance of a wallet address, you can search the address on TomoScan. Testnet: https://scan.testnet.tomochain.com/ Mainnet: https://scan.tomochain.com/ Open your Terminal. Run commands: Open file truffle-config.js, and replace with below code to config TomoChain Mainnet and TomoChain Testnet Create a new file named TomoLuckyBox.sol in the contracts/ directory. Our TomoLuckyBox.sol smart contract will control the core logic for our game. Check full source code of smart contract on GitHub. Let‚Äôs have a look at some snippets code: Constant: We define some constant variables to help our smart contract code easier to read and understand. And we have a nonce, which will be used to randomize our results efficiently Events: We have only 1 event LogRandomLuckyBoxSuccessed, this event will emit when player request to open their selected box and smart contract will random result and return it to player. Events help in conveying state change on the front-end. Functions: NOTE: Current implement of our random is not secure. For production mode, you can use Oraclize or Commit-Reveal for good secure. sendPayment: Help smart contract can send payment to player address.

https://uxdesign.cc/the-curious-case-of-toilet-paper-and-facial-recognition-c204c701fd0f?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,The curious case of toilet paper and facial recognition,My humble experience with using a Chinese public bathroom from a UX perspective.,Jenny Lin,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jenny Lin Follow UX Collective -- 1 Listen Share There are so many fascinating things about how technology is incorporated into Chinese society like the influence of WeChat, e-bikes, and its cashless economy. Unfortunately, this article isn‚Äôt going to be about any of those things; it‚Äôs going to be about toilet paper. Why? Because earlier this year my face was scanned by an automated toilet paper dispenser and I can‚Äôt get over it. This isn‚Äôt an episode of Black Mirror, it‚Äôs real life. China has a problem with toilet paper; it gets stolen all the time. It‚Äôs so bad that most public bathrooms don‚Äôt bother providing it anymore. That‚Äôs why, in Chinese culture ‚Äî the part that no one ever talks about because it‚Äôs too real ‚Äî you‚Äôre expected to carry your own in the form of travel tissue packs (readily available in every supermarket and convenience store, üòâ). However, China‚Äôs tourism industry is rising and since the bathroom part of Chinese culture isn‚Äôt the proudest or the most sanitary, toilet paper is starting to make a comeback to meet tourist expectations. Currently select parks, attractions, and other high traffic areas have been graced with automated (via facial recognition) toilet paper dispensers and it‚Äôs quite a sight to be seen. So if you‚Äôre interested in Chinese culture, inclusive design, or curious about why toilet paper‚Äôs such a big deal, please keep on reading. In order to fully understand why China‚Äôs investing in high tech for a low tech product, there are two things to keep in mind. 1: Public toilet paper gets stolen worldwide, but since China makes up about 20% of the world‚Äôs population, there‚Äôs a lot of paper at stake. 2: The reason why it gets stolen is a reflection of China‚Äôs socio-economic history over the past century; we‚Äôre talking about extreme poverty and lack of education. That changed dramatically in the late 1970s when the government placed economic reforms that have almost entirely erased urban poverty. Right now, toilet paper thieves are generally from older generations who grew up in poverty and people who are currently facing poverty, particularly migrant workers from rural areas. I was really excited when I found out about these dispensers. It was early January and I was with my Aunt in Zuohai Park, Fuzhou when she casually mentioned that there were new machines for toilet paper. I had to try them. In this particular park, there were two dispensers at the entrance of the bathroom and I happily stood in front of one. I made sure my face was in the camera‚Äôs frame, stared at it for three seconds, and like magic, a two foot portion of toilet paper came out. Perfect. Right behind me in line was an older gentlemen. He also stared at the camera for three seconds but this time the camera couldn‚Äôt register his face. He tried to bend down, arch his back, move in closer, then farther away but nothing worked. At one point, a friendly stranger that came out from the bathroom tried to help him by using his own face, but the dispenser politely declined him in Mandarin Chinese because he apparently already received his portion and couldn‚Äôt get more! At this point, a realization came over me and at once I felt uncomfortable and slightly amused. I mean, isn‚Äôt it both hilarious and scary when a machine recognizes your face and denies you toilet paper? I moved in closer to investigate the older gentleman‚Äôs interaction with the dispenser. I noticed that towards the end of his attempt, there was a huge shadow across his face from the overcast since we were in an indoor/outdoor location, making him undetectable to the camera. He eventually gave up. If executed properly, facial recognition and other biometric recognition systems could serve as great opportunities of inclusive design. From my personal experience, the type of toilet paper dispenser I interacted with could definitely be more effective and efficient. Let‚Äôs breakdown the good and the bad: The Pros: 1. Free. The design successfully allows public bathrooms to provide free toilet paper without having to worry about theft. This is already a win considering many places don‚Äôt provide toilet paper at all. 2. Environmentally friendly. It saves paper since it‚Äôs portioned and won‚Äôt allow an individual to take more than one portion within a nine minute interval. 3. It‚Äôs hygienic. Utilizing facial recognition means that people don‚Äôt have to touch the dispenser in order to activate it. The Cons: 1. Waiting on line. There were two dispensers at the bathroom entrance in Zuohai Park. That means people have to wait on line to get toilet paper before even entering the gender divided individual stalls. (Added Pro: At least the dispenser lines are genderless.) 2. Uncontrolled variables. Not all public bathrooms are designed for facial recognition technology to work. If the only free wall space for dispensers is near the entrance of an outdoor bathroom and the camera can‚Äôt pick up someone‚Äôs face because of uncontrollable variables like the weather and amount of daylight, that‚Äôs a problem. 3. Is it even enough? Some people need more than two feet of toilet paper. I‚Äôll leave it at that. 4. Height. If someone‚Äôs a lot taller than the dispenser, on crutches, or has a leg injury, that person is going to struggle with getting their face into frame. On the opposite end, if someone‚Äôs shorter, in a wheelchair, etc. and can‚Äôt even reach the camera, there‚Äôs no way that person can get toilet paper without human assistance. 5. Language. For a machine that‚Äôs meant to be used in high traffic tourist areas, it would be beneficial if there was at least an English translation and braille under every Chinese instruction and signage near and on the dispenser, including the actual interface. The dispenser also only speaks in Mandarin Chinese. 6. Privacy. This is more than just a toilet paper dispenser.

Or ‚ÄúHow do I study this course in such a manner that I can truly master its content‚Äù? I vividly recall asking myself these and similar questions whenever I was about to begin a course. In this short article, I want to share my insights on this subject matter and it is my hope that you utilize this knowledge in making your studies a fruitful learning experience. It is pertinent to note that this is my personal opinion, and thus, should be considered as a subjective view (one based on sound reasoning and experience). In studying an online course in Web Development, I discovered that there are four different learning routes that an individual might take. THE FIRST LEARNING ROUTE: Individuals, who follow this path, usually tend to speed through the entire course. While they actually gain an initial understanding of the subject matter, the acquired knowledge is not retained and is ultimately lost due to lack of enough reflection and practice. THE SECOND LEARNING ROUTE: This category of learners, spend a whole lot of time on the individual sections that make up the course. When they finish a particular section (not the entire course), they visit other online courses that deal on the same topic, hoping that they would get a better understanding of the subject matter by drawing knowledge from multiple sources. The issue with this pattern is that they end up spending too much time on a section in particular and the course in general. Meanwhile, they don‚Äôt make any significant progress, because they are essentially repeating what they already know. THE THIRD LEARNING ROUTE: Those who take this road, neither speed through the course, nor do they bounce from tutorial to tutorial. Rather, they expend a lot of time practicing what they learned in one section before moving on to the next. While this may sound like a good way to study, in my opinion, it is not the best way, because you end up spending more time than is required on a particular section before moving on to the next. One thing I want you to understand is that when you finish an online course, you will have the rest of your life to keep practicing all you have learned, as well as having enough time to study other tutorials. You cannot afford to spend an outrageous amount of time on only one course, neither can you waste time on repeating what you already know by jumping from one tutorial to other tutorials that teach essentially the same thing. Furthermore, it is not the best to use up tons of time practicing the contents of a section before moving to the next section. So, how should a person study an online course? This brings us to the Fourth Learning Route. THE FOURTH LEARNING ROUTE The group of persons who follow this route, understand that all they need is to get relatively comfortable with the absolute basics of a topic before moving on to the next section. Thus, these learners do not simply speed through the course, nor do they get distracted by the multitude of other existing tutorials on the internet. Furthermore, they do not feel the need to practice all there is to practice about that section before moving on. They know that when they finish the course, they can move on to consistently applying all they have learned in the real world for years to come, and possibly take more advanced courses (not repeating the course by taking another course with similar content). Indeed, this last group of learners simply read or watches the individual sections that make up the entire course. At the end of each section, they take a moderate amount of time to practice the core concepts that they have learned before moving to the next section. I must emphasize that the time required to get comfortable with the core concepts of a topic/section will depend on the complexity of the topic itself. Nevertheless, I recommend that if you study a given section for about 5 hours, for instance, you should spend an extra 15 hours in practicing only what you learned in that section. By applying this principle, you won‚Äôt simply speed through the course without retaining anything, and you won‚Äôt spend an unnecessary amount of time on a specific section before moving on (you must move on). Thereafter, when you finish the course, you can keep on practicing all you have learned and even learn new things. I, however, advocate reaching out to other tutorials when an instructor performs poorly on a section of interest. What is important is that you do not deviate from your focus, which is very easy and natural to do. When building things with your newfound knowledge, start with small projects. As you build confidence and gain a deeper understanding, you can advance to bigger projects, so you do not lose motivation. Thanks for reading through this article; I hope you have a fruitful learning experience. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*oooWwP12CyuSmMIa.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*oooWwP12CyuSmMIa.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*oooWwP12CyuSmMIa.jpg"
https://medium.com/@cioapplicationclientalerts/heres-why-your-data-center-needs-to-be-iot-ready-81b2e16496ca?source=tag_archive---------146-----------------------,Here‚Äôs Why Your Data Center Needs to Be IoT Ready,Written by CIOApplications,CIOApplications,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in CIOApplications Follow -- Listen Share The world of the internet is progressively integrating with the world of physical ? things?. Because of this merger, the Internet of Things (IoT) has arisen; a giant global network is connecting all web-enabled products, including people. From your refrigerator and automobile to the cosmonaut circling the earth, our virtual world will connect billions of smart devices. This will create an ecosystem where these ? things? will have the capability to sense, interact and communicate with each other and influence actions without human involvement. This graph shows the number of IoT devices that will be available by 2020. Now with this increase in a number of devices, the amount of data produced will also upsurge. The increase in data will also give an opportunity to businesses in utilising that data to know their customers? better. This also means that all data centers need to prepare themselves for the increase in data, not just in terms of storage but in other aspects as well. Why Do Data Centers Need to Be Ready for IoT? Businesses are shifting their operational models to compete in a world where everything is connected and constant. To tether to this change they need fast data transmission and storage space. Co-location data centers can help these companies compete by providing them quick, scalable and efficient services. Plus, co-location data centers offer geographically distributed data centers to enterprises who need proximity to their end-users and IoT devices. However, the provider of data center co-location services will also need to be ready to the boom in data that IoT will bring with itself. Reasons why data center co-location service providers need to be ready for IoT: 1. Volumes of Data Storage The data of the Internet of Things can come from personal devices, everyday products and large enterprises. The combination of data from these sources can lead to astronomical growth in the quantity of data that will have to be stored in a data center. Statistics suggest that every day more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being created and processed and it will likely rise in the next year. Though data centers have some amount of scalability is always planned for, they will have to plan better for this situation. 2. Security and Privacy of Data With an increase in the quantity of data, the security measures to protect that data in the data centers also need to be strengthened accordingly. The numerous devices used to access data by the clients will also add to the concerns about breach of privacy. These devices may be a small phone, tablet or even a laptop. Moreover, with the introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill or PDPB bill, it has become imperative for data centers to improve their security measures. 3. Network Requirements Most of the co-location data centers come well equipped for bandwidth necessities for access to the data. However, with IoT, the number of connections and the speed of access would both have to undertake substantial improvements. The growing number of devices will also need carrier neutral and carrier dense data centers to reduce costs and increase reliability as well as flexibility of the operations. 4. Scalability Options The surge in the storage requirement of data could also lead to a challenge in the way of the configuration of storage and servers. It is necessary that the co-location data center structure is adaptable enough to make the storage and access most well-organised. 5. Cost-Effectiveness The type of detailed backup data that is possible in the current data center landscape may not be possible with the incorporation of IoT. The CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) and OPEX (Operating Expense) may also not be affordable in terms of the required network bandwidth and data storage. This might boost a requirement for disaster recovery plan with a well-thought-out frequency of performing the operational activities. Amidst all these, the one question that may arise in mind is that if the data centers need to go through so many changes why not opt for the cloud services? Here is the answer: As IoT becomes more dominant, we can expect an effective increase in the amount of data company?s processes. Moreover, as the volume of data expands, the limitations of public cloud platforms will become even more evident. The cloud is not predominantly well-suited to run the applications upon which Big Data hinges on. It primarily relies on the ability to transfer massive amounts of data speedily for which public cloud is not suited. For any enterprise that relies on Big Data for its revenue, the best choice is to move servers, applications, and data into a tier-three co-location facility like STT GDC India. It is a better option than relying on cloud platforms that offer inadequate insight or control of the underlying infrastructure. Moreover, the economic and technological burden of lifting vast amounts of data into the cloud is not a good strategy. The IoT means an increase in the number of data centers in more regions, and co-location service providers are ideally suited to check these needs. Especially in the initial stages of IoT, where new types of information will be shared, companies may feel more comfortable opting for co-location than private cloud services. While this means more business for the data centers, it also involves them being ready for the oncoming wave of IoT.

In fact, many of his designs led to the invention of cutting-edge machinery such as tanks, parachutes and helicopters. It is therefore apt that the United Nations introduced the World Creativity and Innovation Week (#WCID) to begin on his birthday every year. It is in line with this innovative spirit that the inaugural DBS Asia X Creativity and Innovation Day (#DAXCID) was born. The event drew more than 450 participants to DBS Asia X on 16 April to take part in insightful panel discussions on how technology impacts our everyday lives, and workshops on creative thinking and sustainability. Here‚Äôs how the event got participants to put on their thinking caps: In conversation: Relooking the way we live and work Speakers from 14 different organisations spoke across three panel discussions about how companies are adapting to rapidly advancing innovations in technologies. The diverse panels provided a wealth of perspectives about how businesses are evolving in the new age, how they foresee future collaboration models and how workplaces will operate with more digitalisation. Acclaimed architecture photographer Darren Soh also shared how he chronicles Singapore‚Äôs rapidly evolving landscape. He shed light on how he constantly pushes the boundaries of creativity to capture old architecture through fresh lenses, noting, ‚Äúif something is demolished, you cannot bring it back. That‚Äôs why I keep taking pictures.‚Äù Hands (and legs)-on Fun The LEGO ¬Æ Serious Play ¬Æ Workshop was a hot favourite at the event and was well-received by participants. ‚ÄúIt activated a lot of creative juices,‚Äù a participant shared. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how insightful [building items with your hands] can be until you explain [your concept] to people later on.‚Äù During the workshop, participants were introduced to the LEGO Serious Play methodology by certified facilitator Jason Yew, who challenged them to think and ideate brick by brick. With sustainability a core theme of #WCID, Terra SG was invited to conduct an upcycling workshop. Participants were taught how to use their creativity to transform recycled plastic bottles into planters, injecting new life into them. Unique bikes were also stationed at the event to provide heart-pumping fun. The BikeBlender got participants spinning to create their own blended smoothie, while the SpinArt station allowed creativity to run wild as masterpieces were created with every pedal. The robotics station also saw participant-built robots battle it out in an exhilarating game of soccer. While we celebrate #WCID, it is important to remember that creativity permeates our everyday lives, and innovation cannot confined to a week in a year. So, let‚Äôs put on our thinking caps and innovate for a more sustainable future. -- -- DBS creates banking that's fast, natural, effortless.

https://medium.com/@gjkalra/gazing-into-the-voice-activated-future-of-advertising-2475921ef920?source=tag_archive---------119-----------------------,Gazing into the voice activated future of advertising‚Ä¶,Written by Girish J Kalra,Girish J Kalra,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Girish J Kalra Follow -- Listen Share Advertising goes back thousands of years. The Egyptians used papyrus to advertise goods and services. The Athenians used town criers to stroll the streets. A lot has changed in the world of communication since then. As mediums such as television, radio and internet proliferated, so did advertising. From mass messaging earlier, we have reached a point today where every individual viewer can be targeted with a different communication, that is streamed in real time based on the user‚Äôs interest at that point of time. But what does the future entail? How will advertising change as the mediums of entertainment and communication undergo a change? We are fast moving into an era of voice activated AI assistants. The Siris, Alexas and Cortanas of the World have taken center stage. Extending beyond their original hosting platforms that is mobile phones and laptops, these voice activated technologies are making their presence felt everywhere. Smart speakers connected with electronic appliances, light bulbs and fans, security systems, headphones and what not. As the Echos, Pods and Hubs become part of our lives, it is not too far in the future when we will interact more with these devices than with real humans. And when I say not too far, it really may be that. Current global estimates point to 50% of all web-searches being voice-enabled by 2020 and by 2021, there could be more smart speakers than humans on our planet. So how will advertising change in this scenario? Will we see new formats of messaging, will advertising become more intrusive or will its influence reduce as we users gain more control of what we hear? Will we as consumers be as open to advertising as we have been, watching the screens of our televisions, laptops, mobile phones etc. At this point, you may wondering if I have missed out on screen based smart speakers. Yes, many of these smart speakers are adding the screen to their hardware, but essentially they remain a voice activated device at their core. So does it mean that we will have intelligent and customized content marketing conversations playing between our favorite songs or other conversation on a smart speaker? Imagine hearing a customized advertisement message asking you to upgrade to premium economy when you are about to leave for the airport and are taking a breather listening to music before your Ola arrives. Imagine in the next instant, your wife asking Alexa to recite a recipe and being asked if she wants to add her favorite brand of cottage cheese in her Amazon shopping cart. A question to ponder over is how does one seek advertising related permission of customers who have purchased and therefore essentially ‚Äòsubscribed‚Äô to the service. In today‚Äôs context, premium or subscription based services typically promote ‚Äòadvertising free‚Äô experience as one of the triggers for getting someone to subscribe. Given that logic, how will advertisers play their sales/ promotion/ campaign messages on these voice activated AI tools to consumers who have purchased the device and thereby the bundled service of the AI enabled assistant that comes along with the hardware. From the advertisers perspective as well, the future is intriguing. Compared to dozens of ads that populate our screens today, a smart speaker would utter only a single message at any point in time. What will that mean to the advertisers and publishing platforms especially digital that rely on earning dollars by placing ads in every nook and corner of our screen. Will the shift to voice make advertising irrelevant and lead brands to create ‚Äòskills‚Äô that consumers subscribe to, just like they download apps and pay for premium content/ services today. For instance, a television brand launches a skill on maintaining your alexa enabled television or a mobile brand develops a skill on tips on managing the battery of your mobile phone or a travel app introduces a skill on sharing with you, weather conditions before you begin your travel. This could be a dramatic shift and a leap ahead in content based marketing in the voice activated world. The voice enabled future is sure to pave a new way for consumers and advertisers alike. Just like the mobile without a keyboard turned out to be a game changer, voice activated devices too will re-write the rules of the game. How things unfold is something we will get to know in a matter of a few months, if not years. For all you know, Alexa may already have the answer hidden in her skills‚Ä¶ -- -- An observer, consumer, communicator, parent... Life blesses us with multiple roles and experiences. This platform is my attempt to pen down some of them.

Are you anxious about not being able to answer all the interviewer‚Äôs questions? Don‚Äôt worry. If you read this article, you‚Äôll be one step ahead of the competition. Plus, the best way to fight your nerves is to prepare by studying the company and thinking about your answers in advance. It‚Äôs much better to be prepared than it is to wing it. Start your research here, with the list of common interview questions (and answers) we‚Äôve compiled below! How did you learn to program and what is the first thing you programmed? Interviewers aren‚Äôt just asking about which college or university you attended. And they‚Äôre not simply trying to gauge your skills, so don‚Äôt worry if your first program was really basic. There‚Äôs no need to lie about it and upsell yourself on this question. Don‚Äôt be deceived by the simplicity of the question. Interviewers are trying to get a sense of how passionate you are about programming. They want you to go deeper and share how you felt in the moment when you wrote your first program. Talk about the thrill of turning letters, numbers, and symbols into something that works in the real world. What are the most important qualities in a developer? This question is designed to unveil how you feel about the position you‚Äôre interviewing for and the attitude you‚Äôll bring to the job. Interviewers are looking for an answer that strikes a balance between technical, problem solving, and soft skills (e.g. communication). Remember that technical skills are important, but the best developers can learn any new language quite easily. What‚Äôs more important is the ability and the willingness to solve problems. That‚Äôs what programming is all about. But an effective programmer also needs to be a team player. Few software products are built by a single developer, so it‚Äôs important to be able to work collaboratively in a team environment. Great developers are keen problem solvers and are eager to use their skills and energy to move the entire team forward. Finally, a great developer is constantly refreshing their skill set. Because technology trends change so quickly, interviewers are looking for candidates who can adapt to new programming languages, frameworks, and tools. What are your favorite and least favorite technology products? This question is designed to test your enthusiasm and your technical knowledge. Interviewers are also trying to understand your preferences and whether you like the hardware, operating system, and software the company uses. It‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt. But don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like ‚Ä¶ because it sucks.‚Äù Be specific. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of certain tools. Tell the interviewer what you admire about the products you love, whether it‚Äôs a rock-solid or sleek design, intuitive interface, or better functionality for advanced users. You could also talk about the tools you use to write and debug applications. Be sure to tell the interviewer about tools you‚Äôve tried in the past and the reasons why you prefer one over another. If you‚Äôve ever had the opportunity to make the case for adopting new technology at a previous job, now‚Äôs the time to mention it. Explain why there was a need for new tech and discuss your reasoning behind choosing a particular product over another. This is your chance to show off your technical knowledge and insights. Don‚Äôt be shy ‚Äî it‚Äôs OK to get passionate! Can you tell me about a recent side project you‚Äôve worked on? Companies love to hire developers who have side projects because it shows that you actually enjoy coding and it‚Äôs a sign that you‚Äôll take pride in your work. It also proves that you‚Äôre curious, a natural problem solver, and that you‚Äôll keep your skills up-to-date. Remember, problem solving is the most sought-after skill among developers. The best indicator of job performance is how much time developers spend working on new ideas and testing new technologies. Be sure to tell the interviewer what interests you about your side project and describe the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve. Most companies want to hire someone who‚Äôs going to do more than clock in and clock out. If you have an account on GitHub or any other public code repository, now‚Äôs a good time to let the interviewer know. They‚Äôll want to browse it later on to get a taste of what you‚Äôre capable of. If you can demo your product during the interview, that‚Äôs even better! And, of course, if you‚Äôve ever started your own company, be sure to talk in detail about your challenges and successes. Have you ever failed to deliver a product on time? This question isn‚Äôt a test to find out if you‚Äôve ever failed. It‚Äôs a test to find out how you deal with tough situations. Failure is inevitable, especially if you‚Äôre working in an innovative environment. Interviewers are looking for your ability to go through the process of trial and error. They want you to show them you can admit mistakes, learn from them, and continue moving forward with what you‚Äôve learned. The best developers are resilient and thrive in tough situations. They don‚Äôt give up or hide when mistakes are made. Be sure to talk about how you turned a bad situation into a positive situation. Demonstrate that you worked hard to resolve the issue or come up with an alternate solution rather than simply telling your boss or client that there‚Äôs no way to solve the problem. What are some of the more interesting or challenging problems you‚Äôve worked on? Interviewers are trying to understand what you‚Äôve been working on recently. They may ask follow-up questions and probe for details during your explanation to gauge your knowledge. They also want to know about your problem-solving approach. Be sure to tell the interviewer how you solved problems step by step. Go beyond the requirements set out by your boss and dig deeper into how you defined priorities and worked to get things done on time. How do you explain complex technology to non-technical people? They might ask you how the internet works, for example. While it might be tempting to go into details about IP addresses, packet switching, and DNS servers, try to keep it high-level. You could use a metaphor, for example, but you don‚Äôt have to. The key is that you‚Äôre able to communicate complex concepts clearly so non-technical people can understand them. As a developer, you‚Äôll work a lot with other developers. But you will also spend time with non-technical people in HR, marketing, sales, and other technical people with different specialties, so it‚Äôs critical to be able to communicate effectively in non-technical language. Don‚Äôt use acronyms or coding jargon in your answer. Break down technical ideas into simple-to-understand concepts. What management style do you respond most positively to? This is a tricky question that is designed to get how self-aware you are about your working style and the kind of leadership you respect. They‚Äôre trying to understand what motivates you and pushes you to give your best effort. There isn‚Äôt exactly a right answer. They might be trying to gauge whether your preferred leadership style matches their own. But they‚Äôre also gauging your self-awareness, so as long as your answer is honest and insightful, it should go over well with the interviewer. This is also a chance to show you have leadership potential. Even if you aren‚Äôt applying for a leadership position, employers are always looking for leadership qualities that are important for delivering projects on time, such as motivation, positivity, the ability to communicate with team members, and organizational skills. Have you tried our product or made an account on our website? Do you have any suggestions to improve the process? Your answer to this question better start with ‚Äúyes and yes‚Äù! Never go to an interview if you haven‚Äôt even tried the company‚Äôs product. That just shows that you‚Äôre not very interested in the work they do. Interviewers are testing your ability to think like a builder, not just a regular user. They‚Äôre also trying to see how you respond under pressure. So be sure to think critically about the product beforehand and during the interview show off your ideas as if you‚Äôre coming up with them on the spot. The interviewer might even ask if you have a plan for your first six months on the job, so be prepared for that. Your answer will show how much you understand the requirements of the position. Be sure to align your ambitions with the job description, but dig even deeper and talk about specific milestones you would like to hit along the way. Is there anything I haven‚Äôt asked you about that you want to make sure I know? This is your chance to tell the interviewer why you want the job. Don‚Äôt focus on your qualifications; focus on your motivations and aspirations and be sure to talk about how the company is a good match for you. Interviewers are looking for someone who‚Äôs passionate and excited about the prospect of working with them. The worst answer possible is ‚ÄúI just need a job‚Äù. That may be true, but there must be more to it than that. Tell the interviewer what really makes you excited about working for the company. And don‚Äôt talk about perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables. Focus on the actual work and the challenges you‚Äôre excited to help solve. Where do you see yourself in five years? This is one of the most common interview questions in any field, so it‚Äôs a good idea to think about your answer. Do you plan to learn as many new languages and technologies as possible? Are you aiming for a project/product management position?, etc. It‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt know exactly where you want to be in five years. The main thing is to show that you‚Äôve thought about the question and have some drive in you. Remember, interviewers aren‚Äôt solely interested in your coding skills. They‚Äôre trying to gauge your enthusiasm and whether you‚Äôd be a good fit for their company. The best way to show you‚Äôre keen is to do your research beforehand. This article is a great start, but you should also spend time learning everything you can about the company. That knowledge will show that you‚Äôre genuinely interested. Another thing to keep in mind is that interviewers always ask if you have any questions before concluding the interview. You should come prepared with questions to ask. Be careful not to focus too much on salary and benefits: ask thoughtful questions about the company and your potential role.

It can be frustrating how the most simple of tasks can become quite a challenge for people with disabilities, especially those of which involve motor skills. When it comes to driving, these individuals have riskier driving conditions, also becoming a safety problem for others on the road. What if drivers with disabilities could maneuver a vehicle better than the most experienced driver? Imagine the hardships and problems that it could fix, including traffic, accidents, and traveling speed. The development of self-driving cars can bring all drivers more freedom, making roads safer than before. There are a few reasons why many businesses are developing these technologies, benefiting drivers with disabilities in particular. User-Friendly Technology As mentioned, self-driving cars barely need any preparation or driving skills to use. As we experience more advancements in automotive technology, artificial intelligence will drive these vehicles as safely as a professional driver would do. This means that the market will be greater for these companies while more and more people can enjoy the benefits of fast transportation. These user-friendly technologies include constant smartphone communication with the passenger and connectivity with other smart vehicles on the road to increase safety. Freedom And Safety The safety of self-driving cars helps people with disabilities to reach their destination effortlessly, all while enjoying the trip. Drivers could use this freedom to do other tasks without worrying about the vehicle, such as reading a book, watching videos, or taking a nap. Distracted driving could be a thing of the past. Affordable and Accessible You don‚Äôt necessarily have to own one of these high-tech vehicles if it is not convenient for you. Many automotive companies like Uber are implementing a network of self-driving vehicles in different locations. Anytime you can use a smartphone application to pay for the trip, the vehicle will move to your location. It makes self-driving vehicles affordable and accessible to anyone. The Bottom Line Even though self-driving technologies are expensive to develop, they bring many opportunities for people with disabilities. It is a positive way to reduce traffic and increase safety on the road, providing mobility freedom to those individuals who deserve to complete simple activities without limitations.

Much has been written about the growth-engine of this booming industry; namely, the role of the technological units in the Israeli military in training entrepreneurs coupled with the go-getter immigrant mentality that still reigns in this young country. A growth-engine that isn‚Äôt mentioned as frequently is the nation‚Äôs excellent universities and academic institutions that play an important role in cultivating the next generations of audacious founders. Students and academics affiliated with my university, for example, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has gone on to find world-changing companies like MobileEye, Lightricks, and BrainQ. Indeed, from institutional resources to prominent entrepreneurial alumni, HUJI is a great place to be a student startup founder. The resources below do not guarantee your success as a founder, but rather are available to increase the likelihood of success as you start out on your entrepreneurial journey. The guide consists of 3 parts: One of the hardest phases of building a company is the very beginning. Doing this as a student can be even harder as you are not in an environment which revolves around startups. HUJI has identified this problem and in recent years started offering students entrepreneurial programs, hubs, resources and tools to make this journey easier. HUJI Innovate is the Hebrew University‚Äôs platform to encourage and assist students, faculty, and alumni to develop their Innovation and Entrepreneurship capabilities.

Since its inception, Yissum has registered 10,000+ patents covering 2,800+ inventions; licensed 900 technologies and produced 130+ spin-off companies. These are general resources which are not part of the HUJI ecosystem but are worth knowing Although the entrepreneur scene at HUJI is centered around HUJI Innovate, Jerusalem has a vibrant community of startups and tech which might better suit you. Below is a list of some of these resources to help you navigate through your journey as an entrepreneur. AToBE ‚Äî AToBE is Azrieli Academic College of Engineering‚Äôs startup accelerator, gives you the chance of a lifetime to engineer your dream into reality and build your own startup.

Fundraising can be very stressful for entrepreneurs when deadlines need to be met, people need to be paid, and growth needs to happen, but you can‚Äôt do it without a little extra capital. I have provided a few alternative avenues you can take as a HUJI entrepreneur if you need to seek funding outside of the university.

One helpful tool to combat this scourge of short-hand is: Let me explain: When presenting, entrepreneurs often say something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve unlocked product/market fit and are ready to grow!‚Äù This may be true, but it‚Äôs a claim that could as easily be made by the proprietor of a summer camp or any other small business. Even if accurate, almost every pitch that an investor hears starts that way. Companies looking to raise VC are presumed to have a product and a plan for growth that doesn‚Äôt look like a small business. Specific pitches stand out in a field of bland startup pitches. For instance, an entrepreneur who can explain why the product can scale and win the market won‚Äôt have a hard time getting meetings ‚Äî and Camp Emerson won‚Äôt be able to make a similar claim. My advice to entrepreneurs is to scrub your deck with this heuristic in mind. Double check the 20 headlines in your slide deck and make sure none of them could plausibly be used in a small business loan application. medium.com Step back and think about what makes a tech startup unique. It‚Äôs probably some combination of the following: ü§ñ Technology üöÄ Velocity üí™ Leverage üêò Scale üí≤ Margin ‚öî Defensibility üèÄ Team These concepts should be the crux of your pitch. Note: As a proud alum of Camp Emerson, I don‚Äôt mean this as a criticism of small business owners. Mom and pop shops are the lifeblood of many towns, including mine. But those types of companies would be damaged badly by raising venture capital. Words matter. They reveal how you think about your business. Your choice of framing showcases your analytical skills. So choose them carefully. Remember to show that you‚Äôre a CEO, not a CiT. Managing Partner Eric Paley recently shared this as a tweetstorm. We collected the tweets as a post for your convenience.

https://medium.com/sciforce/iot-in-healthcare-are-we-witnessing-a-new-revolution-6bb0ecf55991?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,IoT in Healthcare: Are We Witnessing a New Revolution?,Published in Sciforce,Sciforce,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sciforce Follow Sciforce -- 2 Listen Share When the humanity entered the new era of relative welfare for everyone, better health and longer lives of people brought new challenges for the healthcare industry. When chronic diseases do not kill you, and you can easily live through your 100th anniversary, healthcare providers should adapt their ways of monitoring your health so that they will not be overwhelmed with the amount of your century-long data. One of the possible answers to the new challenges has been the implementation of the Internet of Things for healthcare, or the Internet of Medical Things. Healthcare is such a vast ecosystem, that the applications of the Internet of Things in healthcare seem to be endless: from remote monitoring and personal healthcare to smart sensors and medical device integration, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare insurance, RTHS, healthcare building facilities, robotics, smart pills, and even treatments of diseases. It has the potential to not only keep patients safe and healthy, but to improve how physicians deliver care as well. So far, the IoT in healthcare is mainly focused on remote monitoring and telemonitoring and on tracking, monitoring and maintenance of assets. The cornerstone of it is therefore electronic health records (EHR), the concept of computerized health records which emerged already in the 1980s, but became commonplace only in the recent years. The use of EMR promises to advance coordination of medical care, facilitate interaction with patients and families and reduce disparities in healthcare improving its efficiency. This has become the central idea of telehealth ‚Äî a pool of technologies and tactics to deliver virtual medical, health, and education services. ‚ÄúThe use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration‚Äù, as defined by Health Resources and Services Administration, telehealth has penetrated various fields of healthcare services, including chronic disease monitoring and management, home health, physical and occupational therapy, consumer and professional education, disaster management and even dentistry. Telehealth encompasses four key domains of applications: Live video: Live, two-way interaction between an individual (patient, caregiver, or provider) and a provider using audiovisual telecommunications technology. Live video can be used for both consultative and diagnostic and treatment services. Store-and-forward technology: Transmission of recorded health history such as pre-recorded videos and digital images through a secure electronic communications system to a practitioner to evaluate the case or render a service without live interaction. Remote patient monitoring: Personal health and medical data are collected from an individual in one location and afterwards are transmitted to a provider in a different location for use in care and related support. In this way the provider can track healthcare data for a patient once released to home or a care facility, reducing readmission rates. This approach can maintain individuals‚Äô health in their home and community, without making them physically go to the providers‚Äô office. Mobile health, or mHealth: Healthcare and public health practice and education supported by mobile communication devices such as smartphones, tablets, or PDAs. Applications can range from targeted text messages to wide-scale alerts about disease outbreaks, or whatever other option you choose for yourself. The integration of EHR systems with the IoT can create broad personalized healthcare solutions which could enable the following: Wearable devices and home health monitoring devices assisting patients is a common thing now. Such healthcare devices as insulin pumps, defibrillators, scales, CPAP machines, cardiac monitoring devices and oxygen tanks are now connected in the IoT to ensure remote monitoring, providing patients and their caregivers valuable real-time information. Wearable devices, for example, can immediately send out alerts for emergency medical help. Fitness bands, even though marketed as ‚Äúwellness solutions‚Äù rather than medical devices, can take vital data from the body throughout the day and transmit wirelessly to computers, smartphones or tablets. Moreover, some medical device manufacturers already offer a cloud based platform that enables wireless transfer, storage, and display of clinical data. This platform provides for interoperability with a variety of medical devices and apps and generates enormous amount of clinical data which would help the healthcare industry in many research. Internet of Things (IoT)-based medical devices can get patients out of the hospital more quickly, or keep them out altogether, and save organizations money. On the other hand, interconnectivity can provide for easy data collection, asset management, OTA updates and device remote control and monitoring. Continuing the line of other ‚Äúsmart‚Äù facilities, ‚Äúsmart hospitals‚Äù constitute hospitals of a new type that can optimize, redesign or build new clinical processes and management systems thanks to digitized networking infrastructure of interconnected assets. Smart hospitals rely on optimized and automated processes, built on the Internet of Things and on the big data revolution which combines connected devices with cloud computing, big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). The smart hospital involves three essential layers ‚Äî data, insight and access. Data is being collected on the daily basis, to be fed to analytics or machine learning software to derive a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù insight. It is this new ability to provide a valuable insight that makes a hospital a step further from being just digital, making it truly smart. This insight must be accessible to any potential user ‚Äî a doctor, a nurse, facilities personnel or any other stakeholder, through an interface including a desktop or a mobile device, so that they could make critical decisions faster. There are three areas that any smart hospital addresses ‚Äî operations, clinical tasks and patient centricity. Efficiency at operations can be achieved by building automation systems and implementing smart asset maintenance and management solutions, improving internal logistics of mobile assets and control over people flow. Efficiency in clinical tasks is concerned with ways to improve doctors‚Äô and nurses‚Äô work efficiency, especially the emergency, surgery and radiology areas. Clinical efficiency also involves improving patient outcomes by ensuring patient engagement and monitoring. Patient centricity of smart hospitals means improving the patient experience, such as building a smart patient room, which allows voice-based interactive devices such as Amazon Echo with Alexa or tablets, to call nurses or dim the lights. Smaller-scale but fascinating applications of the IoT in healthcare include development of devices that make patients‚Äô lives more comfortable: Hearables are new-age hearing aids that are compatible with Bluetooth which syncs the patient‚Äôs smartphone with them. This approach allows filtering, equalizing and adding layered features to real-world sounds. Ingestible sensors. These pill-sized sensors monitor the medication in the patient‚Äôs body and warns if it detects any irregularities. The immediate application is for diabetic patients as it might curb symptoms and provide with an early warning for diseases. Moodables are mood enhancing devices which are capable of improving our mood. Moodables are head-mounted wearable devices that send low-intensity current to the brain to elevate our mood. Computer vision technology and AI in general has given rise to drones which aim to mimic visual perception and decision making based on it. Drones can also help visually impaired people to navigate. However, these developments are rather scattered and far from perfection. The main obstacles, like elsewhere in the IoT, are the cost, challenging integration of multiple devices, and, above all, data security and privacy. Nevertheless, integrating IoT features into medical devices shall transform the healthcare service, bringing especially high value for the elderly, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to some estimates, spending on the IoT solutions in healthcare will reach $1 trillion by 2025 and, hopefully, will provide everyone with personalized, accessible, and up-to-the-point healthcare services.

https://medium.com/deepstream-tech/uncompetitive-procurement-processes-in-the-international-oil-industry-eeda22f847a7?source=tag_archive---------169-----------------------,Uncompetitive procurement processes in the international oil industry,Written by Jack Macfarlane,Simon Tran,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Simon Tran Follow -- 1 Listen Share This month (September 2017) Redburn published a follow up report to their report last year (‚ÄúThe Ubers and AirBnBs of Oil Services‚Äù) around how new collaborative digital platforms could finally reduce bloated procurement costs in the oil and gas industry. You can find links to the full reports at the end of this article, but I‚Äôve summarised the key findings: Much of the rationale for the DeepStream vision is encapsulated in both of these Redburn research reports. Compared to other industrial industries (e.g. automotive, aerospace), costs in procurement remain bloated and overdue for a dramatic improvement in efficiency. The tell all stat that ~10% of headcount at the Majors is in procurement (dwarfing the ratio found in other industrial industries) is indicative of how much money is being wasted in inefficient processes. The silver lining of the oil price decline and squeezed profits is that the infamously change-averse industry is now being strong-armed into adopting new best practices to survive. It is not easy going, and we are constantly surprised of how impervious the inefficient but tried and tested ways of doing business in oil are gas procurement are. Only last week I sat with the head of ‚ÄúProcurement and Supply Chain Transformation‚Äù at one of the Majors, who told me his answer to reduction in industry procurement cost was having fewer suppliers (‚Äúrationalising the supplier base‚Äù) to be able to squeeze them harder on a relationship basis to reduce cost. This strategy flies in the face of the conventional economics that governs all other industries, and ignores the clear and intuitive benefits of creating a dynamic and competitive supplier base. This is the same person who employs a team of 40 people to run correlations to back solve what the ‚Äútrue‚Äù cost of equipment was that they were purchasing. So much for market forces. This primitive approach to trade is costing the industry hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars every year. The positive is that for each person clinging to their ‚Äòtried and tested‚Äô processes, we meet at least 10 who are chomping at the bit to try out new collaborative digital technology such as DeepStream. My gut instinct tells me that we are at an inflection point in the industry. The old guard will peter away into the past, whilst the organisations that are pro-active and open-minded about change and digital technologies will thrive and expand.

They have to do an inordinate amount of administrative work every day, leaving many struggling with how to organize and prioritize their work. One task that is especially difficult to prioritize on a busy day is sending classroom updates to parents. Teachers understand how much parents appreciate receiving regular updates about what is happening in class and how well their children are doing. But these updates can be very time-consuming. Parent updates don‚Äôt have to be stressful, though. A handful of familiar technologies make it easy to touch base with parents. Classroom blogs and websites are especially useful for posting updates. What‚Äôs more, the sites‚Äô visual nature allows teachers to easily showcase student work. These platforms are also a great way to engage parents in conversations about learning. Linda Yollis, an elementary school teacher, advocates for using a classroom blog as a communication tool because it brings families together to discuss education. She came up with Family Blogging Month in an effort to get parents to contribute to their children‚Äôs learning by commenting on blog posts. What can really help teachers is getting students involved with updating these sites. With some planning and creativity, write Aviva and Haskel Weiss, founders of Fun and Function, you can easily turn updating the site into a project for your students. In doing so, you can reduce, if not eliminate, the amount of time you spend on that task. You also create an incentive for students to encourage their parents to engage with the site. Classroom messaging tools are a great way to share updates. They allow teachers to push out updates to all parents at one time, as a group, within the messaging tool ‚Äî a time-saver for teachers. The ‚Äúpush‚Äù nature of these tools also helps teachers ensure that parents receive the updates. Teachers understand that not all students communicate classroom information to their parents in a timely manner. Through messaging apps, however, teachers can instantly connect to and share pertinent information with parents, explains education writer Janelle Cox. Parents, in turn, have direct access to their kids‚Äô teachers. Messaging tools are also extremely flexible, which helps reduce the stress of communicating with parents. Teachers can post images of flyers, pictures of student activities and work, or simply share a brief text message with parents. There are a number of messaging apps designed specifically for teachers. Matthew Lynch, Ph.D., dean of the School of Education, Psychology, and Interdisciplinary Studies at Virginia Union University, lists some of this favorites, which include A lot of parents already use social media, so why not reach them there? Though somewhat controversial for education purposes (think privacy), social media can be a great tool for engaging with parents and sharing updates because there isn‚Äôt a learning curve. Parents are already comfortable with the platforms. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even Pinterest can be used to keep parents updated. The catch is that you will not likely reach all of your parents on one platform. You will probably need to update several social media accounts to reach everyone. Knowing this, you may want to consider using social media as a secondary tool. But don‚Äôt rule it out completely if it fits your processes and helps you meet your communication obligations. If you go this route, be mindful of school, district, and state policies about using social media to communicate with and about students, teacher Kathleen Morris warns. If you need more guidance on using social media in the classroom, Tanner Higgin at Common Sense Education has written an informative post about protecting student privacy on social media. There are a number of programs and resources available to help teachers design newsletters ‚Äî Microsoft Word, MailChimp, and Lucidpress are just a few. When using programs with templates, you can quickly create digital newsletters to update parents. Educational consultant and former teacher Angela Watson prefers using email newsletters because it‚Äôs easy to make sure parents receive them. She believes email works well for busy parents because they can check it on their own time. And using programs with templates is a big time-saver for Watson. Once your template is created, you simply have to plug in the information and send. The rub is that newsletters can become overwhelming if you try to create them on an ad hoc basis. The best way to get email newsletters to work for you is to set a regular schedule and commit to it. Block out the necessary time once a week, once a month, or whatever works for you, and knock it out. Then don‚Äôt work on another one until the next scheduled time. What you are trying to avoid is sending the same updates multiple times to reach all your parents, as well as constantly having to respond to their feedback. This is a drain on both your time and mental resources. Once you have determined how you will send updates to parents, communicate that information to them at the beginning of the year, writer and mother Barbara Mariconda advises. Also, let them know what your process for responding to their replies will be. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to, and don‚Äôt try to, respond immediately to every parent. This is the quickest route to burning out. Choose your tools, develop your processes, and then set expectations with parents early. This will help create a harmonious balance between meeting your obligations and maintaining your sanity.

Get a green mohawk, throw on a studded leather jacket, and make something light up, and boom ‚Äî cyberpunk! But the true spirit of cyberpunk, as it goes back to its literary origins, is in hacked tech. Real cyberpunk is a bunch of futuristic tech smashed together to do something new. Imgurian Keyofnight‚Äôs Cyberpunk Laptop fits the latter definition perfectly. Take a quick look at this laptop and you‚Äôll immediately see why. Every component, down to the individual keyboard key caps, looks mismatched and hacked-together. Circuit boards are exposed, and everything is mounted inside a vintage wood Mahjong case. Despite the purposefully-crude construction, it somehow manages to be both incredibly stylistic and utilitarian. It looks cobbled-together ‚Äî but with a purpose, and that‚Äôs the true essence of cyberpunk. Style aside, this is a pretty useful build. The heart of the laptop is a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and the screen is an Adafruit 5"" LCD connected by HDMI. It‚Äôs powered by a 12,000mAh LiPo battery through an Adafruit Powerboost 1000C.

It‚Äôs about change. I left the Blockchain convention in Hamburg (Blockchance, 17th-18th of August) both impressed and motivated. Impressed not only on the sheer number of attendees but because how much the technology has evolved. As a lawyer working in the Public Sector, it‚Äôs a challenge to keep track of what is possible and what is already done through blockchain. What might come naturally to ‚ÄûTechies‚Äú in this regard, I can learn and understand from listening to great speakers explaining the advancement in excellent overviews (and Blockchance 2019 sure had quite a few of them). www.datadriveninvestor.com However, it left me even more motivated. I‚Äôm interested in the way blockchain can change our society, our governmental organizations, maybe even the way we think and act on so many levels. The financial aspects of blockchain, especially making money with cryptocurrencies, are of little interest to me and my daily work. Therefore I‚Äôm always a little skeptical when attending such a conference, as it sometimes appears to me as if it is all about shaking the gold pot. Blockchance wasn‚Äôt. Think big and change the world Many speakers, among them the charismatic thought-leader Marc Buckley (UN SDG advocate), sent out a message to the audience. We can change the world with blockchain technology, and to do so, we all must change our minds. Marc Buckley underlined that technology could do so much more, and we use so little of ist potential so far. Astronauts travel to the moon using state-of-the-art technology but must claim their expenses filling out a paper formula after the trip. His story reminded me, even while I don‚Äôt do space-travel, very much of the places I‚Äôve worked: using state-of-the-art technology in some aspects and also counseling on it, but not going that final step to digitize my work and that of others entirely. What more could I have achieved for others and myself if I only changed my mind on things? If we find this phenomenon on a company level, where it‚Äôs all about reducing costs and being efficient, how much do we have of this on administration and governmental level? I know from my work in the Public Sector first hand: A lot, a whole lot. What would happen if we change our approach if we fully digitize procedures, files, supply chains, and everything else? So to speak: if we digitize the very way we think about the world? What if we embrace technology, do not see a threat in it, and go all the way? The Deloitte key speaker Nicolai Andersen made a good statement on people‚Äôs fear towards technology, here concerning AI technology. We discuss the fear of being run over by an AI-driven car with all our heart, but not the chances such cards offer. Just think of older people living in small villages, for who every trip tot he doctor is a hard challenge. What good could the AI-driven car do for them? It feels as if people prefer to be run over by a human than by a robot. So what can we do? Let us stop pondering all the threats technology can offer at first impression: Let us first think of all the possibilities, let us dream, let us think big, and then address all the possible miss-uses/dual-use cases and the inherent problems. However, let us first think of technology as a real problem solver for the world. I believe this is where Marc and other speakers were pointing us towards, and I like the direction. Recently I read this great article by Renee Yang: ‚ÄûBlockchain needs selfless people.‚Äú Many speakers proved that this is precisely the mindset they are living out, not only the before mentioned Marc Buckley but also speakers like Dr. Juie Maupin from IOTA or Albert Peci from Blockchance. I enjoyed this mindset: Let us embrace technology to make the world better for all beings. How does blockchain fit into this? About cooperation and transparency Quite a few speakers lined out that blockchain technology can‚Äôt solve all problems. Nearly everyone lined out: Blockchain technology isn‚Äôt good or bad, nor selfless, nor evil. Only people are and the way we want to use blockchain. We must use it fort he common good. Blockchain offers great possibilities, in its decentralized technology, in ist neutrality and its transparency. It can boost cooperation, between national and international organizations, between people and companies, because as the transactions within the collaboration become transparent and secure, trust arises. As someone who has written many cooperation contracts in the Public Sector, knowing how every party is worried about being taken advantage of, I can embrace this idea wholeheartedly. If cooperations can work better through blockchain technology, the world will become a better place naturally. Because wherever people work together and trust each other, there will be less hate and cheating. Moreover, cooperations in the Public Sector are necessary, to challenge climate change, to challenge hunger and poverty, to challenge migration risks and criminal behavior on a global scale. The omnipresent Facebook‚Äòs Libra Facebook‚Äôs Libra was a big subject as well. It did not come as a surprise when even I had published on that matter. I did, however, not experience the usual disdain towards Facebook that I usually encounter when talking about this subject. Some speakers and attendees underlined that Libra could also offer a strong possibility to the blockchain community, as it could lead to a mass-adoption of blockchain technology worldwide and address underbanked people. Those speakers of course also questioned if Libra is a cryptocurrency at all, or even if we can call it a blockchain solution, as it is neither decentralized nor neutral. Most speakers and people I talked to, however, agreed that the whitepaper on Libra was just a ‚Äûtry and error‚Äú-approach, meaning Facebook published it to see the reactions on that matter worldwide and then adjust to it once it comes to concrete adoption. We also discussed the question if others, such as Amazon, are not sitting back right now, letting Facebook do all the dirty work and then come up with their neat solutions once the path has been made clear by Zuckerberg & Co. I found this very differentiated discussion on Libra quite refreshing. The big company world Nonetheless, the big company world was visible too at Blockchance, at least from a German point of view. Moritz von Bonin from Deutsche Bahn (the national ‚Äûtrain company,‚Äú so to peak) gave a very thoughtful presentation on the possibilities of blockchain concerning the railway system, and it was good to hear that even this very conservative Germans company is looking into the technology. To no surprise came to me that the most prominent German car companies, Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW, are very interested in the technology, as autonomous driving won‚Äôt ‚Äì from my point of view ‚Äì be possible without blockchain or another distributed ledger technology. What interested me as a lawyer though was the fact that the car companies addressed the following issue: The representatives of the companies did not argue the idea that a mutual blockchain solution would be the best option, as a ‚ÄûVolkswagen blockchain‚Äú parallel to a ‚ÄûDaimer blockchain‚Äú does not make sense at all, as it speaks against all what autonomous driving does need. However, and here‚Äôs the exciting part, anti-trust regulations in Germany and the European Union might even forbid that the companies talk at all about a standard mutual solution. For me, this is a typical example of how ‚ÄûLaws from the analog times‚Äú might prevent digital advancement that is in the common interest. We must change this in Germany and Europe. Asap. Be a visionist The Tron Europe representative Frank Schulze said something that stuck with me: When it comes to blockchain, be a visionist. I like this. Of course, I can‚Äôt claim that I am one, but we can all try to develop the mindset of one: Let us think big. Let us imagine a world in that blockchain technology plays a significant role to make things better for everyone. Don‚Äôt le tour fears or worries stop us from making the first step: Imagine how everything can be changed through blockchain, not to make money, but to make the world a better place.

Societies are defined in large part by which one they chose. The U.S. made the choice of freedom. The government keeps out of people‚Äôs lives, mostly. Taxes are also much lesser than in Europe. Which means more freedom. And more inequalities. Europe made the other choice. Taxes are high and the government is everywhere. Which means less freedom. But also a true safety net and more equality. The future, starting today, will force us to make the ultimate choice between freedom (i.e. ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù), and equality. Because data is the most valuable commodity. But data, especially the gold mine that‚Äôs our personal information, is owned by just a few companies. These companies generate tremendous profits and unprecedented economic efficiencies. Which makes them rich, but which also leaves the rest of the world with not so much to share. The fact that data ownership is so concentrated creates huge inequalities. Little privacy for big inequalities. The other choice would be that data belongs to no one. Every bit of information is public. Very little privacy. Very little freedom to act without everyone knowing about it. But also much equality. Would you rather everyone know about your sexual inadequacies and stop worrying about money? Or have just a few huge companies know about these inadequacies, because Alexa overheard what‚Äôs going on in your bedroom, but maybe not be able to make a living? That‚Äôs the choice that we have to make today. It might determine the kind of society we‚Äôll be living in tomorrow. -- -- Meditation Enthusiast / Wannabe Athlete / Psychedelic Adventurer / Work in Progress Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*3GPyjt-59wUJR0aRNyyyqQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*3GPyjt-59wUJR0aRNyyyqQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*3GPyjt-59wUJR0aRNyyyqQ.png"

Readers should refer to the Quras technical whitepaper for details on the mechanics of implementation. Transparent addresses work similarly to what is implemented on Bitcoin. The private key is generated randomly first out of the key pair, and the public key is then derived using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). QURAS uses a secp256r1 standard for its public key generation, which is enforced by organizations such as the NSA. Although Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 standard for its key pair generation, QURAS uses an alternative as an extra measure of security. Users can choose between two industry-leading private transaction methods, zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) and ring signatures. The former is considered as a more robust method of privacy; however, will consume more system resources to produce the result. Thus, the second option of Ring Confidential Transactions is offered to give users an option of fast and light anonymous transactions. To accommodate for these transaction types, users can generate the appropriate keys to construct the transactions ‚Äî spend, receiving, viewing, anonymous and stealth keys. The QURAS blockchain includes a virtual machine layer, which users can use to deploy smart contracts written in C#, a widely adopted programming language.7 Developers can utilize two key functions within their contract code ‚Äî zero-knowledge proof and validation methods. These functions are general purpose and can be implemented in the contract code for a wide variety of use cases. As these privacy methods are merely functions, developers freely choose to use them in order to create transparent or secret contracts. Whenever a user calls (interacts) with a smart contract, QURAS GAS is consumed. There are two types of anonymous transactions ‚Äî complete anonymity and partial anonymity. Completely Anonymous Transaction means all transaction information will be hidden including sender‚Äôs address, recipient‚Äôs address, remitted amount, etc. A Partly Anonymous Transaction means a part of transaction information such as the sender‚Äôs address, recipient address or remittance amount is hidden. A Part Anonymous Transaction uses zk-SNARKs or the ring signature technology to realize the anonymous effect. For more details, please refer to the technical paper. -- -- Secret Contract Platform for Privacy 2.0 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*skuFTZ7xzvcivj0SSzW5Vw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*skuFTZ7xzvcivj0SSzW5Vw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*skuFTZ7xzvcivj0SSzW5Vw.jpeg"

And the oil players have already established their footprints in this segment. Also, the growing industrial sector is on the way of setting up efficient machinery to be used in the factories. The demand from the industrial machinery and equipment application also accounts for a major market share and is driven by the end-user sectors such as power, manufacturing, logistics, automotive manufacturing, and others. The growth of the power sector has already highlighted the industrial oil in our country. With the prospective textile sector, the untapped industries which are yet to explore are steel manufacturing, cement, and the growing plastic. And in the near future, the manufacturing of automotive vehicles and motorcycles will create the opportunity for the marketer. To know the current status of it, we tried to find out the key barriers that are facing by the marketer. With extensive working experience in the industrial arena, Rajat Chakraborty, Assistant General Manager to Runner Lube and Energy Limited, said, ‚ÄúWe mostly face the short cummings on technical knowledge among the user end.‚Äù Most of the case, it has been observed that the operators of the production unit of the factories use OEM product until the warranty period of the machinery, which is recommended by the manufacturer. But after that, the operators have a tendency to change the brand to save a little amount of money. In this regard, Mr Rajat said, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we found that to save a little amount of money for purchasing the oil, you are playing with the lifespan of your machine.‚Äù ‚ÄúImmediately, you aren‚Äôt facing any trouble. But in the long run, the lifespan of your highly expensive machinery is in threat,‚Äù he added. Currently, industrial oil segment holds the third-largest demand after mineral-based monograde segment and automotive-based multi-grade segment. With an estimated annual consumption of around 45,000 tonnes in 2018 that is projected to reach the 52,500 marks by 2019. This industrial sector accounts for around 30% of the total lubricant oil consumption. -- -- South Asia Fellow at Climate Tracker Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*tp1O5HGshWiAnr04JKIqRg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*tp1O5HGshWiAnr04JKIqRg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*tp1O5HGshWiAnr04JKIqRg.png"
https://medium.com/@Telosfeed_es/el-ecosistema-del-blockchain-b0ffe4a806bb?source=tag_archive---------122-----------------------,El Ecosistema del Blockchain,Written by Telos Feed ES,Telos Feed ES,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Telos Feed ES Follow -- Share El blockchain no es solo un protocolo o un sistema de programaci√≥n, sino que es considerado como un ecosistema; como tal, est√° compuesto por una serie de elementos que interact√∫an entre s√≠ y con los usuarios permitiendo un funcionamiento √≥ptimo de la plataforma. Los elementos principales de este ecosistema son el registro compartido, la aplicaci√≥n de nodos, la m√°quina virtual y el algoritmo de consenso. A continuaci√≥n se describir√° cada uno y c√≥mo es la interacci√≥n entre ellos. El registro, o libro mayor, es un t√©rmino originario del mundo de la contabilidad definido como ‚Äúun documento que recoge de manera cronol√≥gica todas las operaciones contables de la empresa registradas en cada una de las cuentas‚Äù (Economipedia). En el ecosistema del blockchain este t√©rmino fue tomado para denominar as√≠ a su base de datos o registro; √©sta es compartida, replicada y sincronizada a trav√©s de los usuarios de una red descentralizada (en el caso de la red del blockchain). Dichos usuarios, o m√°s espec√≠ficamente nodos, se encuentran a cargo de grabar transacciones entre pares o P2P (datos din√°micos) y registros (datos est√°ticos) al mismo tiempo que mantienen toda la informaci√≥n disponible para los dem√°s usuarios. En Telos Blockchain estos nodos son conocidos como productores de bloque (BPs) o testigos. Un registro compartido tiene tambi√©n el beneficio de no requerir de intermediarios, lo cuales normalmente cobran honorarios y centralizan el sistema. Al mismo tiempo este registro hace eficiente el almacenamiento de datos al evitar el duplicado de la informaci√≥n y su distribuci√≥n errada a trav√©s de los usuarios; esto ahorra tiempo y dinero. Para poder garantizar la seguridad y auditabilidad de las transacciones almacenadas en el registro, cada transacci√≥n tiene una marca de tiempo y es marcada con una firma criptogr√°fica √∫nica. En Telos, cada BP y auditor tiene su firma propia registrada en un contrato inteligente, respectivamente en el ‚Äúregproducer‚Äù y el ‚Äúregarb‚Äù. De esta manera cada transacci√≥n validada y registrada lleva una firma de los nodos que la autorizaron. Este procedimiento permite la inmutabilidad del sistema, lo que es una de sus principales caracter√≠sticas, y es clave para mantener la seguridad del sistema para los usuarios. Esto es garantizado gracias al procedimiento de validaci√≥n y registro de transacciones: criptogr√°ficamente, cronol√≥gicamente y √∫nicamente luego de ser aprobado por los nodos, dependiendo del consenso de algoritmo del sistema. De esta manera se previenen los cambios al bloque luego que la transacci√≥n ha sido completamente validada y la siguiente est√© en proceso de validaci√≥n. Inclusive, si alguien intenta hacer alg√∫n cambio en un bloque, todo quedar√≠a registrado. En el blockchain, la principal caracter√≠stica de seguridad, y b√°sicamente lo que permite a este tipo de sistemas existir de forma descentralizada, son los algoritmos de consenso. Estos mecanismos a prueba de fallas se utilizan en el blockchain para unificar las decisiones de los nodos, o sus contribuciones, respecto a las transacciones, de esta manera valid√°ndolas o no. Es por esto que se les llama algoritmos o mecanismos de consenso; son utilizados para alcanzar un consenso entre los nodos para validar transacciones, producir bloques y asegurarse que el funcionamiento de la red sea continua y segura. Este funcionamiento es de gran importancia para mantener la seguridad del registro compartido y mantenerlo disponible para todos los usuarios, al mismo tiempo que se evitan los duplicados. Actualmente, existen tres principales mecanismos de consenso aplicados por las redes de blockchain: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) y Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Por ejemplo, Bitcoin, Ethereum y Litecoin usan PoW, NXT usa PoS y tanto EOS como Telos usan el mecanismo m√°s novedoso: DPoS. En el protocolo de consenso PoW la red est√° compuesta por nodos, o mineros en este caso, que se encargan de validar y registrar las transacciones en la cadena. Para lograrlo, estos deben tener grandes recursos computacionales para resolver c√°lculos complejos para producir el bloque, el minero que resuelva el √∫ltimo valor del hash es el que recibe la recompensa. Debido al creciente n√∫mero de mineros, la dificultad del algoritmo para resolver los hash es cada vez m√°s compleja, por lo que dichos mineros requieren recursos computacionales cada vez mayores para resolverlos. Esto √∫ltimo trae como consecuencia que minar sea cada vez m√°s costoso y haya m√°s consumo de energ√≠a. En el mecanismo PoS no existen mineros, sino BPs, quienes son seleccionados dependiendo del n√∫mero total de tokens que poseen; mientras m√°s tokens tengan mayor ser√° el n√∫mero de bloques sobre los cuales podr√°n trabajar. Este m√©todo nace como una alternativa al PoW, ofreciendo menores costos de operaci√≥n y menor consumo de energ√≠a. El registro es mantenido por estos usuarios seleccionados; sin embargo, este sistema gener√≥ lo que se conoce como ballenas; usuarios con grandes cantidades de tokens a comparaci√≥n del resto, son los seleccionados para validar bloques, lo que les da m√°s poder para decidir sobre el sistema. En respuesta a este inconveniente, se comienza a implementar el mecanismo DPoS. En √©l, los BPs son seleccionados por todos los token holders a trav√©s de un sistema de votaci√≥n. Por eso, los BPs tienen que demostrarle a la comunidad que son merecedores de su voto al desempe√±arse exitosamente en su rol de validadores de transacciones, producci√≥n de bloques y mantenimiento general del mainnet y los testnets. En el caso de Telos, el sistema de votaci√≥n tiene una ponderaci√≥n inversa; esto significa que el peso del voto de un usuario depende de la cantidad de votos que emita. Cada token holder tiene un n√∫mero m√°ximo de candidatos a BP por los que puede votar, si votan por esa cantidad total de candidatos su voto alcanza su valor total; si por otro lado emiten menos votos, el peso del mismo disminuye. Este sistema evita votos favorables y propicia un alto rendimiento de los BPs. A continuaci√≥n se muestra una comparaci√≥n de los diferentes algoritmos de consenso. La m√°quina virtual fue definida por primera vez en 1974 por dos cient√≠ficos computistas: Gerald J. Popek y Robert P. Goldberg. Ellos la definieron como ‚Äúun eficiente y aislado duplicado de una computadora real‚Äù. B√°sicamente se trata de un emulador de una computadora que puede correr software o hardware para ejecutar programas en un ambiente virtual. En blockchain, Ethereum fue la primera plataforma en adoptar la m√°quina virtual dentro de su ecosistema y la llamaron M√°quina Virtual de Ethereum (EVM por sus siglas en ingl√©s), la cual permite a los usuarios programar sus propias operaciones o transacciones. La idea era correr un protocolo a trav√©s de una red P2P para operar como el backend y as√≠ ejecutar acciones (como contratos inteligentes escritos en lenguajes de programaci√≥n) y potenciar las Dapps, mientras el computador f√≠sico es operado por los nodos. El EVM, por ejemplo, se encarga espec√≠ficamente de confirmar la validez de las firmas y los valores en una transacci√≥n, calcular los cargos por la transacci√≥n y ejecutar la transferencia requerida en dicha transacci√≥n. Con las m√°quinas virtuales los desarrolladores pueden correr sus Dapps sin requerir de instalaci√≥n o contrataci√≥n de servidores. Todo el RAM, las transacciones y el almacenamiento de los datos se realizan en el blockchain; este proceso es seguido en Telos Blockchain. √âste est√° construido con la m√°quina virtual de EOSIO conocida como WAVM, es la m√°quina virtual de WebAssmebly (WASM). Los contratos inteligentes son escritos en C++ y luego compilados y ejecutados con WASM, que es un formato binario capaz de ejecutar una variedad de lenguajes de programaci√≥n tales como Python, Ruby y Java. El WAVM se caracteriza por una m√°quina de pila (o stack machine) basada en un sistema de apilamiento last-in, first-out y un programa contador. Este sistema de apilamiento lo permite ser un objeto de c√≥digo compacto, con compiladores simples, interpretadores simples y control de flujo f√°cil. Por √∫ltimo, la aplicaci√≥n de nodo es el software a trav√©s del cual el usuario (nodo) se comunica con su computadora a la red del blockchain y al registro compartido. La m√°quina virtual y el consenso de algoritmo forman parte de la aplicaci√≥n de nodos mientras el registro compartido est√° almacenado en la misma. ‚ÄúEn un √°mbito un poco m√°s t√©cnico, el ecosistema del blockchain constituye una red superpuesta de servicios (SON por sus siglas en ingl√©s) y para ser un nodo en esta red tu computadora debe ser capaz de procesar mensajes espec√≠ficos de la aplicaci√≥n de nodos que afectan el estado compartido del SON‚Äù No est√° dem√°s entonces decir que la aplicaci√≥n de nodos es para el ecosistema del blockchain como la tierra lo es para nuestro ecosistema. -- -- Vimos el futuro y luce como una nuez.

https://medium.com/manas-tech/where-to-start-with-ux-design-dfc4dda40120?source=tag_archive---------152-----------------------,Where to start with UX design?,An introduction to how we design and build user-centered experiences,Mart√≠n Pettinati,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mart√≠n Pettinati Follow manas.tech -- Listen Share In this context of sharing economies, empowered users and the ‚ÄúInternet of ratings‚Äù (don‚Äôt google that, I just made the term up), we see a rise of experts, thought leaders and consultants talking about the ever-growing relevance of the User Experience. This article is meant to give you an introduction to UX design: an approach to what takes place during the process of designing experiences; ones that take into account what we want our users to feel like when interacting with our products and services. But not just any generic approach to UX design: this is Manas.tech‚Äôs own way to tackle it. Paraphrasing the Rifleman‚Äôs Creed, ‚Äúthere are many like it; but this one is ours‚Äù. If you‚Äôve been working in UX for a while, this article probably won‚Äôt bring you any kind of epiphany, but I find it‚Äôs always nice to share how one does things as a way to maybe expand someone else‚Äôs knowledge, give them a fresh point of view, or get feedback that allows us to improve. So here goes. User-centered design means working with your users all throughout the project. - Don Norman Often, when reading case studies, it‚Äôs common to find that they narrate the process of developing a tool or system like if things just magically fell into place. After reading those accounts, one is often left to wonder ‚Äúwell.. yeah, but how exactly did they do it?‚Äù. Usually, no answer is provided. This article strives to do just the opposite. There are two basic principles to good design, as described by Don Norman, in his book ‚ÄúThe Design of Everyday Things‚Äù: In short, good design is intuitive and interactive: users shouldn‚Äôt have to wonder what to do next, or where to find things, and every time they interact with a tool, they should have a way to know that their action was received, and that something happened because of it. Building a great User Experience (UX) requires understanding the users, their mindsets, what they are trying to accomplish (their jobs-to-be-done), and the environmental constraints they operate within. Good questions to always keep in mind are ‚Äúwhat is this for?‚Äù, ‚Äúwho is this for?‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhy did we put this here?‚Äù. The first question helps you focus on the purpose of what you‚Äôre building, what it will do for the user; the second question one helps you keep the user in mind, how their experience will be affected by your intervention; and the third one is a reminder of the decisions that were made every step along the way. This last question is also a way to ensure that whatever you are building stays as lean as possible, and that you don‚Äôt waste time or resources: if you ask ‚Äúwhy did we put this here?‚Äù and can‚Äôt come up with a good, satisfying answer, maybe you should re-evaluate whether it should go there. The emotions that users experience when they interact with the thing you‚Äôve built largely determine the way they think about it, and how they evaluate it. That is why it‚Äôs important to design and build the User Experience with intent. If you can manage to get that right, you can trust that your users will have a delightful experience, and thus they‚Äôll be delighted with your product. At Manas.tech, our approach to this is simple and straightforward: we start with a concrete user, who is affected by a concrete problem, and every effort we put into it is directed towards helping the user solve their problem or some aspect of their problem, with as little friction as possible for them. The first mission is getting to know the user. It‚Äôs already been said a bunch of times and you‚Äôve probably heard it before. But it‚Äôs never enough. Get. To. Know. Your. Users. There are two main ways to tackle this part: It may sound counterintuitive to hold an interview with stakeholders before interviewing actual users, but it is fundamental to understand the stakes of the project, and the change the team is trying to make in the world. Also, the stakeholders are the best source of information to get a grip on the project‚Äôs constraints: how much time, budget and support we can count on. This will produce a Findings Document, that will be of great use when we get to the user interviews. Interviews with users will ideally be performed on-site, ethnographically, and there we will put our findings to the test, and lay the groundwork for the next step: building Personas. In case you‚Äôve never heard the term, ‚ÄòPersonas‚Äô is a documentation tool. Though it may sound like one should attempt to depict users as accurately as possible, it is an exercise intended to understand and describe the needs, goals and motivations of a prototypic user. Once we have our Personas in place, we can begin to craft short stories about them trying to achieve their goals or get a job done, by using our tool in their context. These are what we call Scenarios, and they are useful to imagine how each Persona will interact with our tool in real life. Once we have researched our users in depth, built Personas and had them play out in Scenarios, we can make some educated guesses about the way our tool will be received and used. Still, no guess is as good as the real thing, so the best thing we can do is build a preliminary version of the tool and have some users play with it. Let‚Äôs see how this works in a real project. Brium is a tool we built for ourselves, and it has a very simple yet meaningful mission: it tracks the time that each member of your team spends on different activities, by asking them, via chat, what they are doing. A couple of words a day is all it needs to provide accurate timesheets. It all started out with a fairly simple problem: how can we improve the way we bill our clients for the work that we do? On one hand, we need to know how people are spending their time, since that information is what we use to bill our clients. The usual approach to billing for worked hours is making people fill out timesheets. But, as we know, everyone hates timesheets: most times they don‚Äôt get filled out in the moment, but at the end of the week or the month, and that leaves a lot of room for error; how are people supposed to remember what they did 4 days ago, or how long they were at it? So, improvement meant collecting this information faster, more accurately, and with less dependency on human action. Put in a few words, the problem goes like this: Let‚Äôs say you manage to get people to actually fill out timesheets, and by some miracle the data is complete and accurate. You still have one more hurdle to overcome: accounting still needs a way to keep track of billable, non-billable and billed hours. That‚Äôs a whole other headache! Our approach to this problem was to take it apart into two major components: These two components respond to the two kinds of users that operate in this system: employees who log in hours, and accounting/administrators who use that input to bill clients. So any good solution had to encompass the needs of both. We came up with this: A chatbot that can be easily integrated with messaging services like Slack, Telegram and XMPP chat clients. The mechanics are beautifully simple: Brium asks people, a few times a day, what they‚Äôre working on. They respond using a keyword. And that‚Äôs it. Administrators can then decide how activities should be reported, and how much or how little detail they need Brium to ask people to report. People can answer with messages like ‚Äòemail‚Äô, ‚Äòtraining‚Äô or ‚Äòacme-bizdev: call with customer‚Äô and Brium will understand and create an entry. Back to Don Norman‚Äôs principles, discoverability is addressed by making the system responsible for initiating the circuit, and by using a channel that users already use and are accustomed to: the bot talks to users via chat, and all they have to do is answer, like they do with any other chat. Along the same lines, feedback is provided with a message that simply and directly states ‚ÄúGot it‚Äù and, in case the user misspells the keyword or that a keyword isn‚Äôt recognized, Brium replies with a warning message that lets the user know that they need to check their answer or provide a new one. As far as the two components we divided the problem into, proactive action from users is no longer an issue, since Brium gets the ball rolling by asking people what they‚Äôre working on. This brings another benefit: since users are no longer reporting every few days, trying to recall what they were doing 4 days ago, we get the highest possible accuracy in your reports. And as far as the consolidation problem goes, administrators can see, at a glance, the status of the billing pipeline. Every entry has 3 stages in Brium: reported, allocated and billed. A simple interface allows administrators to quickly allocate entries to projects, and set them as billable or non-billable. Brium also has an interactive dashboard that displays the broad view of all entries per month. Simple, easy, efficient. No more cumbersome spreadsheets, a lot less room for human error and missing or corrupted files, and oh, so much time saved! That‚Äôs why we put a chatbot where a timesheet used to be. Years upon years of designing and developing custom software and complex information systems have earned us a very valuable body of lessons learned and knowledge about the workings of building experiences. One of those lessons learned is that the best way to test discoverability and feedback is giving the thing you‚Äôve built to real people and observing them while they use it to try and solve a concrete problem. The reason this works is that it puts together a winning combo: real people, in real settings, with real constraints, producing very real outcomes. The User Experience design goal, then, should be an intuitive and interactive user interface (UI), one that creates no doubt in the users‚Äô minds about how to operate, what to do next, and the results they should get from each action. UI and UX are often named as two sides of the same coin, and that is because a good interface makes for a good experience. We also learned that it‚Äôs not so important to get it right on the first try; it‚Äôs actually much more important to build the smallest, most discardable version of the tool, while maintaining all the functionalities we want to test. And then, of course, test it. Why? Because it allows us to learn fast. By understanding that whatever gets built, it won‚Äôt remain the same forever, it no longer makes sense to strive for perfection: the goal is to build something useful and delightful. And in the process, learning as much as we can, so the next cycle is always more efficient than the one before. -- -- We build unconventional software, and here we talk all about it Ideas need to be clear in order to be passed along, to find the others.

Classification is one of the two sections of supervised learning, and it deals with data from different categories. The training data-set trains the model to predict the unknown labels of population data. There are multiple algorithms: Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision tree, Naive Bayes etc. All these algorithms have their own style of execution and different techniques of prediction. To find the most suitable algorithm for a particular business problem, there are few model evaluation techniques. In this article different model evaluation techniques will be discussed. It probably got its name from the state of confusion it deals with. If you remember hypothesis testing, you may recall the two errors we defined as type-I and type-II. As depicted in Fig.1, type-I error occurs when null hypothesis is rejected, which should not be in actual. Type-II error occurs when the alternate hypothesis is true, but you are failing to reject null hypothesis. In figure 1 it is depicted clearly that the choice of confidence interval affects the probabilities of these errors to occur. But if you try to reduce either of these errors, it will result in the increase of the other one. So, what is confusion matrix? Confusion matrix is the image given above. It is a matrix representation of the results of any binary testing. For example let us take the case of predicting a disease. You have done some medical testing and with the help of the results of those tests, you are going to predict whether the person is having a disease. So, actually you are going to validate if the hypothesis of declaring a person as having disease is acceptable or not. Say, among 100 people you are predicting 20 people to have the disease. In actual only 15 people to have the disease and among those 15 people you have diagnosed 12 people correctly. So, if I put the result in a confusion matrix, it will look like the following ‚Äî So, if we compare fig.3 with fig.2 we will find ‚Äî Now if I ask what is the accuracy of the prediction model what I followed to get these results, the answer should be the ratio of the accurately predicted number and the total number of people which is (12+77)/100 = 0.89. If you study the confusion matrix thoroughly you will find the following things: Now, you may ask the question that why do we need to measure precision or recall to evaluate the model? The answer is it is highly recommended when a particular result is very sensitive. For example you are going to build a model for a bank to predict fraudulent transactions. It is not very common to have a fraudulent transaction. In 1000 transactions, there may be 1 transaction which is fraud. So, undoubtedly your model will predict a transaction as non-fraudulent very accurately. So, in this case the whole accuracy does not matter as it will be always very high irrespective of the accuracy of the prediction of the fraudulent transactions as that is of very low percentage in the whole population. But the prediction of a fraudulent transaction as non-fraudulent is not desirable. So, in this case the measurement of precision will take a vital role to evaluate the model. It will help to understand out of all the actual fraudulent transactions, how many are being predicted. If it is low, even if the overall accuracy if high, the model is not acceptable. Measuring the area under the ROC curve is also a very useful method for evaluating a model. ROC is the ratio of True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) (see fig.2). In our disease detection example, TPR is the measure of the ratio between the number of accurate predictions of people having the disease and the total number of people having the disease in actual. FPR is the ratio between the number of people who are predicted as not to have disease correctly and the total number of people who are not having the disease in actual. So, if we plot the curve, it comes like this ‚Äî The blue line denotes the change of TPR with different FPR for a model. More the ratio of the area under the curve and the total area (100 x 100 in this case) defines more the accuracy of the model. If it becomes 1, the model will be overfit and if it is equal below 0.5 (i.e when the curve is along the dotted diagonal line), the model will be too inaccurate to use. For classification models, there are many other evaluation methods like Gain and Lift charts, Gini coefficient etc. But the in-depth knowledge about the confusion matrix can help to evaluate any classification model very effectively. So, in this article I tried to demystify the confusions around the confusion matrix to help the readers. In the early 2000s, Songza implemented a manual music recommendation system for its listeners, where a team of music experts and curators would create playlists. But these recommendations were not objective, as they were dependent on the personal taste of the curators. It was an average experience for listeners, with a fair share of hits and misses, because it was impossible to make a playlist which catered to the varied tastes of a diverse set of people. The technology and the data did not exist back then to build a playlist that would be personalized to the taste of each individual listener. Along came Spotify a few years later, offering a highly personalized weekly playlist called Discover Weekly that quickly became one of their flagship offerings. Every Monday, millions of listeners receive a fresh playlist of new song recommendations, customized to their personal tastes based on their listening history and the songs they‚Äôve engaged with. Spotify uses a combination of different data aggregation and sorting methods to create their unique and powerful recommendation model that‚Äôs powered by machine learning. ‚ÄúOne of our flagship features is called Discover Weekly. Every Monday, we give you a list of 50 tracks that you haven‚Äôt heard before that we think you‚Äôre going to like. The ML engine that‚Äôs the main basis of it, and it‚Äôs advanced some since, had actually been around at Spotify a bit before Discover Weekly was there, just powering our Discover page‚Äù ‚Äî David Murgatroyd, Machine Learning Leader at Spotify. Spotify uses three forms of recommendation models to power Discover Weekly. 1. Collaborative Filtering Collaborative Filtering is a popular technique used by recommend-er systems to make automated predictions about the preferences of users, based on the preference of other similar users. On Spotify, the collaborative filtering algorithm compares multiple user-created playlists that have the songs that users have listened to. The algorithm then combs those playlists to look at other songs that appear in the playlists and recommends those songs. This framework executed by matrix math in Python libraries. The algorithm first creates a matrix of all the active users and songs. The Python library then runs a series of complex factorization formula on the matrix. The end result is two separate vectors, where X is the user vector representing the taste of an individual user. Vector Y represents the profile of a single song. To find out users with similar taste, collaborative filtering will compare a given user vector with each and every single user vectors to give a similar user vector as the output. The same procedure is applied to the song vectors. Spotify does not only rely on collaborative filtering. The second recommendation model used is NLP. 2. Natural Language Processing NLP is the ability of an algorithm to understand speech and text in real-time. Spotify‚Äôs NLP constantly trawls the web to find articles, blog posts, or any other text about music, to come up with a profile for each song. With all this scraped data, the NLP algorithm can classify songs based on the kind of language used to describe them and can match them with other songs that are discussed in the same vein. Artists and songs are assigned to classifying keywords based on the data, and each term has a certain weight assigned to them. Similar to collaborative filtering, a vector representation of the song is created, and that‚Äôs used to suggest similar songs. 3. Convolutional Neural Networks Convolutional Neural Networks are used to hone the recommendation system and to increase accuracy because less-popular songs might be neglected by the other models. The CNN model ensures that obscure and new songs are considered. The CNN model is most popularly used for facial recognition, and Spotify has configured the same model for audio files. Each song is converted into a raw audio file as a waveform. These wave forms are processed by the CNN and is assigned key parameters such as beats per minute, loudness, major/minor key and so on. Spotify then tries to match similar songs that have the same parameters as the songs their listeners like listening to. With these key machine learning models, Spotify is able to tailor a unique playlist of music that surprises its listeners every week with songs they would have never found otherwise. A key problem in many machine learning models is the lack of access to clean, structured data that can be processed. Spotify has been able to circumvent that problem due to their access to massive amounts of data that they collect from their users. They‚Äôve been able to shine as a great example of effective use of Machine Learning models to give their users an unrivaled personalized experience.

This activity becomes a profit land with productivity that guarantees in the future. Simply put, trading can be interpreted as a process of buying and selling currencies simultaneously between one country and another. Trading was chosen because this activity has so many advantages such as time and place that is flexible, fluctuations in prices that rise rapidly and can be personally authorized. Since the presence of Blockchain technology in the midst of the world‚Äôs technology industry, trading has increasingly caught the attention of the world‚Äôs public. This is because Blockchain is the cause for the birth of new currencies that have the potential for optimal profits in the trading world compared to fiat currencies in general. This currency is known as the crypto currency. Not only as a milestone for the birth of the crypto currency, Blockhchain is also a driving force for the birth of sophisticated platforms that contribute so much to the progress of all sectors of the world industry. One platform that was born using this technology is Liquiditex. Liquiditex is a platform designed to meet human needs in trading activities. As explained previously, this platform has used a new technology called Blockchain. This technology is a recent innovation that works with 2 highly reliable operational systems. These systems are called decentralized systems and encryption systems. Decentralization is a system that works by providing full access control for each user without being able to be acquired by other external parties, be it the government or a banking institution. While encryption is a system that provides multiple layers of data protection. Every user name, signature and even password will be protected in multi-protection by going through a gradual verification process. Seeing the reliability brought by this technology, it guarantees confidence in the performance of a platform that has used the technology. To become a trader at Liquiditex, users can start by registering themselves on this platform using an email account that is still active. For registrants who have successfully passed the process and have become a Liquiditex client, a digital wallet can be used as a tool to deposit their coins or tokens. Henceforth, they can carry out trading activities using the capabilities they have. On this platform, a trader can exchange their dollars with cryptocurrency like BTC, XRP, and ETH. In addition, users can also exchange their cryptocurrency like Bitcoin with Ethereum on this platform. These money can be traded only in a very short time. This is because this platform has been committed to creating a trading platform with optimal performance and using very sophisticated technology. Liquiditex has prepared 1,000,000 shells for clients who have registered on this platform. Each user who has successfully registered and successfully passed the complete ID verification process will be given 20 shells. In addition, each user who successfully invites a friend to join this platform and passes the ID verification process, each will be given 20 additional shells. Shell is a form of loyalty provided by the liquiditex platform for their favorite clients. The more number of shells collected, it will place a person at the highest rank and have the opportunity to get a large profit opportunity on an airdrop activity carried out by this platform. This offer is certainly a very interesting opportunity and should not be wasted. Liquiditex is a platform created with the principle of simplicity that will make it easy for their clients to trade on this platform.

[They] worked to turn legal attitudes to antitrust on their head, allowing decades of corporate concentration and increasing market power‚Ä¶[and] a wave of deregulation from the 1970s to the 1990s, and provided the intellectual case for tax cuts from the 1960s to the 1980s‚Ä¶. But overall growth never rose as‚Ä¶promised. Inequality widened. Workers and communities increasingly lost out to firms‚Ä¶[and] recessions stoked by monetarism did immense harm‚Ä¶. [Economists] were often‚Ä¶accomplices to a broader movement of conservatives determined to reverse the encroachment of the state‚Ä¶passionate about reducing tax and regulation‚Ä¶[and] the easy ascent of a few ideas that appealed to the wealthy and powerful‚Ä¶. [Also] ignored critics‚Ä¶within the profession‚Ä¶[warning] theories did not adequately capture society‚Äôs complexities‚Ä¶[but] too impressed with their own intelligence to consider the unintended consequences‚Ä¶[or] implications of the politics that allowed them to enact their ideas‚Ä¶. Often, their theories operated on the assumption that the self-interested actions of the rich would benefit everyone, even as those self-interested rich used the same economists to pursue their own agenda.‚Äù https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/08/31/when-economists-ruled-the-world ‚Äú[T]he allure of semi-automated war never faded‚Ä¶[but] is being supercharged by‚Ä¶artificial intelligence (AI)‚Ä¶[and] ‚Äòpoised to change the character of the future battlefield‚Äô‚Ä¶. The Pentagon‚Äôs budget for 2020 has‚Ä¶$1bn on AI and over four times as much on unmanned and autonomous capabilities that rely on it‚Ä¶.[China] wants to lead the world in AI by 2030‚Ä¶[and] Putin famously‚Ä¶[said] ‚Äòwhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world‚Äô‚Ä¶. [T]he paradox is that AI might at once penetrate and thicken the fog of war‚Ä¶[at] a speed and complexity that renders it essentially opaque to humans‚Ä¶. [Military] applications into three sorts. One is to allow machines to act without human supervision. Another is to process and interpret large volumes of data. A third is aiding, or even conducting, the command and control of war‚Ä¶. [Still] many modern AI systems combine rule-following with added randomness as a stepping stone to more complex planning. DARPA‚Äôs Real-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making (RAID) software aims to predict the goals, movements and even the possible emotions of enemy forces five hours into the future‚Ä¶. ‚ÄôFor Chinese military strategists‚Ä¶AlphaGo‚Äôs victories was the fact that an AI could create tactics and stratagems superior to those of a human player in a game that can be compared to a war-game‚Äô‚Ä¶. [I]f algorithms that surpass human creativity also elude human understanding, they raise problems of law, ethics and trust‚Ä¶proportionality (between civilian harm and military advantage) and necessity‚Ä¶. ‚ÄôWhat do we do when AI is applied to military strategy and has calculated the probabilistic inferences of multiple interactions many moves beyond that which we can consider‚Ä¶and recommends a course of action that we don‚Äôt understand‚Äô‚Ä¶[yet] might result from the AI grasping a political chain of events that would not be immediately perceptible to commanders‚Ä¶. [A]n AI might support, if not take over, decision-making in real-world warfighting‚Äô by using a ‚Äòmassive near-real-time simulation‚Äô‚Ä¶.[Military] already purchasing a‚Ä¶cloud-based virtual replication of a complex operating environment ‚Äî known as a single synthetic environment‚Ä¶using open standards, so everything from secret intelligence to real-time weather data can be plugged in. ‚ÄòIt will revolutionize how command and control is done‚Ä¶[creating] a ‚Äòsingle synthetic command tool from the national security council down to the tactical commander‚Ä¶. It seems likely humans will be increasingly both out of the loop and off the team in decision-making‚Äô‚Ä¶.The result would not only be autonomous weapons, but an automated battlefield. At the outset of a war, interconnected AI systems would pick out targets‚Ä¶and choreograph rapid and precise strikes to destroy them in the most efficient order. The wider consequences of that remain unclear. The prospect of accurate and rapid strikes ‚Äòcould erode stability by increasing the perceived risk of surprise attack‚Äô‚Ä¶[or] AI might equally‚Ä¶parry such blows, by identifying the telltale signs of an impending strike‚Ä¶. [N]o power wants to risk falling behind‚Ä¶.[Since] ‚Äòdata is the fuel of AI‚Ä¶China may have a structural advantage over the rest of the world.‚Äô‚Äù https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/09/07/artificial-intelligence-is-changing-every-aspect-of-war medium.com ‚Äú[New] robot consisting of multiple units that can operate as a cluster, responding to‚Ä¶their environment without the need for any centralized control ‚Äî much like living cells‚Ä¶[and] capable of more sophisticated behavior‚Ä¶.

[T]here are concerns that AI could allow unskilled humans to come up with the necessary blueprints, thanks to‚Ä¶generative design‚Ä¶process [where] a user can give a computer a design problem and set requirements for the final result. The AI suggests many possible solutions, and humans pare down the results‚Ä¶.NASA recently used the technique to create a prototype lander for space missions‚Ä¶ [3-D] manufacturing and AI creates three major risk areas‚Ä¶. ‚ÄôGiven the speed at which technology is advancing‚Äô‚Ä¶3-D printing could be part of the WMD supply chain within the next 10 years.‚Äô‚Äù https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/3-d-printers-could-help-spread-weapons-of-mass-destruction/ medium.com ‚Äú[A] company named Made In Space is building‚Ä¶first self-manufacturing satellite, due for launch in three years‚Ä¶[using] 3D printers and automated assembly‚Ä¶. 3D printers have already done several tours of duty on the International Space Station‚Ä¶[and] Made in Space‚Ä¶will manufacture two ten-meter-long wings of solar arrays‚Ä¶generating ‚Äòas much as five times more power than traditional solar panels on spacecraft‚Ä¶[using] recycled waste polymer on the ISS. They plan to manufacture optical fiber in space which would ‚Äògreatly outperform‚Äò standard fibers‚Ä¶and are interested in 3D printing metals‚Ä¶. 70% moondust can be mixed with 30% polymer‚Ä¶that can be heated into 3D feedstock for a remarkable one-thirtieth the energy cost‚Ä¶[with] ambitious long-term plan to construct spacecraft from asteroids.‚Äù https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/02/3d-printers-on-the-final-frontier-made-in-space-is-building-satellites-that-build-themselves/ ‚Äú[T]he production of the world‚Äôs first 3D-printed plant-based beefsteak in 2018‚Ä¶[now] meats like steak, chicken breasts and other fibrous textured meat replacements‚Ä¶[with] a new scaffolding technology that mimics the texture, appearance, nutritional and sensorial properties of fibrous meats‚Ä¶. While many clean meat and plant-based food companies have‚Ä¶meat replacements‚Ä¶with similar taste and textural qualities to the real thing, steaks and cuts of muscle meat have proven harder to replicate‚Ä¶. [Novameat] customized printer that enables companies to create the kinds of fibrous tissues needed to make a steak‚Ä¶‚Äôproviding the equipment, the machinery, under a licensing agreement‚Äô‚Ä¶[and] speeds up the time to create meat substitutes‚Ä¶. [The] company‚Äôs micro-extrusion technology enables companies to get a three-dimensional structure‚Ä¶[and] provides a flexible and tunable method of producing plant-based meat, with the utility to create different textures from a wide variety of ingredients, all within a single piece of meat‚Ä¶. [This] gives plant-based meat manufacturers a wider array of tools to mimic all types of meat and seafood.‚Äô‚Äù https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/novameat-has-a-platform-for-3d-printing-steaks-and-has-new-money-to-take-it-to-market/ ‚Äú[I]n five to 12 years‚Ä¶a pill that could‚Ä¶stave off the fragility, osteoarthritis, memory loss, macular degeneration and cancers that plague old age‚Ä¶. [T]he science of senolytics: an‚Ä¶area of anti-ageing medicine‚Ä¶more concerned with prolonging‚Ä¶‚Äòhealthspan‚Äô than [lifespan]‚Ä¶to age with less pain and illness‚Ä¶with a lot of benefits, both for governments and older patients‚Ä¶. [Ageing] is the biggest risk factor for most chronic diseases‚Ä¶[so senolytics] targets senescent‚Ä¶so-called ‚Äòzombie‚Äô cells linger and proliferate as we age, emitting substances that cause inflammation and turn other healthy cells senescent, ultimately leading to tissue damage throughout the body‚Ä¶. [2019] a small early human trial showed an improvement in the distance patients were able to walk‚Ä¶[and] injecting a senolytic drug into the knees of people with osteoarthritis showed promising, if mixed results‚Ä¶. [Theoretically] it should prove impossible to build up a resistance to the drugs, ‚Äòbecause senescent cells cannot proliferate‚Äô‚Ä¶[and] there is significant data to show ‚Äòthat‚Ä¶just treat them once a week or once a month‚Ä¶[will] have huge benefits‚Ä¶. [Also] obesity can cause senescent cells to develop prematurely‚Ä¶[so] clearing senescent cells improves insulin sensitivity‚Ä¶.[and] senescent cells ‚Äòplay a big role after cancer treatment‚Äô, developing as a result of chemotherapy and radiation therapy‚Ä¶[so] a detrimental side-effect‚Ä¶could be alleviated‚Äô‚Ä¶. [T]he ideal treatment age will differ from person to person, and‚Ä¶a blood or urine test that can assess the level of senescence present [soon]‚Ä¶. Intermittent fasting may have senescent effects‚Ä¶[and] linked to healthy ageing and longevity. Mouse trials have shown that they can live 30 to 50% longer than control animals‚Ä¶. [A] healthy diet, ‚Äòreducing the amount of animal protein‚Ä¶[to] once per week, maximum‚Ä¶[because] association between low protein intake and longevity is well established in humans‚Ä¶[so] protein should come from vegetables.‚Äô‚Äù https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/02/the-science-of-senolytics-how-a-new-pill-could-spell-the-end-of-ageing Find more of my ideas on Medium at, A Passion to Evolve.

Because WeWork leverages technology and scale to lower costs, increase flexibility, and improve the office experience, companies across the world will outsource office creation and management to WeWork. Co-working is merely the springboard. WeWork is an overhyped-Regus with a frail capital structure, no scale benefits, no network effects, and dangerous liabilities. It will likely collapse during a recession. Although bias is unavoidable, many people unfortunately allow preconceived notions to compromise their WeWork judgments both positively and negatively. These two questions help expose bias. If someone offers an opinion yet cannot answer fundamental questions, the opinion most likely reflects bias and not insight. Beware informed, but biased, opinions. For illustration purposes, if research reveals there are 500mn knowledge workers and only 20% need to rent, this yields a market size of 100mn users. All questions should benchmark WeWork against direct competitors and the internal teams of large companies. Debating tech vs. non-tech is a distraction from what matters. What matters is fast growth and strong moats. Torrid growth is undeniable. In 2018, WeWork grew revenue over 100% compared to the previous year. For contrast, Marriott grew sales about 1% in 2018. The argument hinges on WeWork‚Äôs defensibility and pricing power. Choosing the appropriate multiple requires comparing WeWork‚Äôs growth and moats to alternative equity options. For instance, Salesforce has slower growth but arguably stronger moats while Marriott may have stronger moats but zero growth. What‚Äôs the right multiple?

The data lake needs to serve for access of data, understandability of data and trust in the data in order to generate excitement and stimulate demand and adoption. However, data lake implementations often fail to serve these objectives and end up into data swamps or muddied waters. What are some of the common mistakes and incorrect assumptions that lead to data lake failures? What are the key considerations for implementation and activation of a successful Data Lake? Setting up Data Lake is more than just the technology. It is about getting people, processes, organization and technology together to establish the right data foundation. 2. People: It is important to understand that not everyone in the organization is data-literate. What are the training and coaching needs of people for data definitions, tools and most importantly, the data-driven mindset? 3. Organization: It is important for the organization to align to the vision of establishing ‚Äúdata‚Äù as a ‚Äúbusiness asset‚Äù. Removing data silos, fostering a collaborative style, aligning on the data definitions within the organization are some of the imperatives to establish a data-driven culture. Integrating multiple business units by establishing a single and harmonized source of enterprise data is crucial to the success of data lake implementation. 4. Technology: There is no one size that fits all. Multiple tools and technologies need to coexist to meet the various needs around ingestion, processing, storage and access of data. If the organization is interested in open source, it is important to be active in the open source community, and to keep monitoring the changes, advancements and their value to the program.

Since the beginning this Red (due to iron oxide on its surface) planet is like crazingly famous for humans to live. It has been a part of our culture for very long time. Various ideological movies and the recently MARTIAN which is considered as one of the most apt and correct sci-fi movie ever created making us see how life on mars could be like . So all the mark watney out there be prepared to get answered ‚Ä¶WHY MARS? Genius Billionaire like Elon Musk already on the way to apply the idea to colonize of mars. All things are just perfect for us to be inter planetary civilizations and a step closer in becoming type 1 civilization (my previous blog),but have you ever wondered why only mars why not other planets or moons. First thing first missions like Europa ,Titan etc all are going on and they provide a promising future but it will take a lot of time to even study them and we don‚Äôt know what circumstances we might exactly encounter in future, yet for mars we have already mapped 100% of the surface due to help of our rovers and satellites. So what are the conditions that other planets are not considered for us humans to live: MERCURY: Mysteriously confusing temperature variation,and it is one of the least researched planet. VENUS: Closer than mars for 26 million miles from earth at its closest point while 160 million at its farthest having 80% the mass and has the 90% the gravity of earth. Its is often considered as earths twin but it also has a surface temperature of 462 degree Celsius (earth has 16 degree Celsius) and surface pressure is 92 bar (earth has 1 bar) it will crush any rover sent there, the last rover only survived for 2 hours. Now, if you go 31 miles above the surface this becomes favorable to live but for that we will be needing flying cities or prototype projects like HAVOC(High Altitude Venus Operational Concept) super cool concept to be mentioned.. These below planets are really really far away‚Ä¶. JUPITER, SATURN, NEPTUNE and URANUS: They are gas giants and lack surface to stand upon. PLUTO: It is not even considered as planet but also I mentioned and it is surprisingly cold. PLANET X: A bit conceptual and we really have to study of its existence yet it will be exactly like Earth but 10 times bigger. If this planet gets discovered it will be a ground breaking discovery and all the ideas of colonizing mars would be thought again. All these conclude the fact that mars is the optimum place and we are looking in the right direction. As things moving so fast it seems the starting of sending humans to mars and research will get started within this decade.

In fact, his scheduled check-ups and every other detail related to him are collected and secured with the help of technology. The ever changing technology has become a part of our lifestyle. These technology trends are such that having a working knowledge of robotics, programming, Artificial Intelligence, IOT is a must for all. STEM skills today have become a must for all children. If we give it a thought, it‚Äôs not difficult to engage your child in tech activities. These days a child‚Äôs first pal is mobile, he is keener to explore the realms of mobile technology than any other toy you might offer him. Similarly, as he grows older his grasp of technology is much more than we can fathom. Hence it‚Äôs easy to indulge him in technology. However, to make him serious for technology is a different ballgame altogether. STEM skills are in great demand today and they will remain so in the days to come. We have to ensure that the coming generation is fully equipped to deal with the hurricane of change awaiting them in the near future. Here are a few ways in which you can trigger your child‚Äôs love for tech: Indulge your child with STEM Toys: Gone are the days when parents bought dolls or cars for their child to play. These days market is flooded with STEM toys for all ages. They play a dual role by giving your child a new toy to play with and learn something new and worthwhile at the same time. Let him explore: Kids learn by exploring and we should let them discover the hidden gems of the latest technology. Become their student and try to learn from them. This gives them confidence in their abilities and also pushes them to learn more about the subject. Share awesome technology invention stories: There are so many wonderful stories to share with your child. Stories of successful technologies, stories of people who are behind that success.

The possibilities and benefits of technology are endless and the advancing tech trends are imperative for the utilities like water, electricity, oil, and energy in a substantial way. The transformation that the new and existing technology brings has notable benefits for businesses. Utilities are tasked with balancing disruptive forces at an increasing rate with a deep commitment to customer satisfaction. With a customer-centric mindset, leveraging new technologies will help utility companies adapt and thrive ahead. Top Technologies Guiding the Utility Industry ‚Ä¢ Cloud Cloud-based software has enabled businesses of all sizes to take the benefit of speed, security, and scalability. It has also helped software organizations in deploying, refining, and updating offerings with features and enhancements in ways that were earlier not possible for software installed on office local machines. Many enterprise software suppliers are cloud-first, offering the best of the needed features. ‚Ä¢ The Internet of Things (IoT) Utilities have the responsibility to manage pipelines, powerlines, dams, among others, to make up the infrastructure. This enables them to generate and deliver power and water. Nowadays, users are increasingly comfortable with connected lights and other smart devices in their homes. With the help of apps and smart speakers, intelligent network connectivity is expected to get better and accurate steadily. Check This Out: Top Electric Utilities Companies ‚Ä¢ Artificial Intelligence Constant connectivity and increasingly more intelligent equipment add up to a lot more data being collected and in need of being processed. Every other business is in the data businesses virtually. Technology Guiding Utilities Utility Tech Innovations Leading Ways to a New World Full of Possibilities Unique tech innovations contribute to exploring new utility landscapes and meeting the rising demands of the modern customer. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics contribute to regular developments in the utility industry, optimizing the delicate, demeaning, demanding, dangerous and, dull operational approaches. AI and robotics in the utility workplace ensure the increase in productivity while maintaining quality. Here are a few such intelligent innovations transformation the utilities. ‚Ä¢ Autonomous Vehicles The incorporation of autonomous vehicles helps streamline public transit. As it utilizes the remote sensors and automation, it can augment and replace current transit for safer and more efficient operations with the help of AIs. It can be initiated by taking more vehicles off the road and reduce emissions and traffic accidents. Taking measures like sharing autonomous shuttles offer a convenient, efficient, and cost-effective ways of transportation. It also reduces traffic congestion and missions and alleviates the need for additional transit station parking. It can provide more economical and reliable mobility services, increasing the access for senior citizens and accommodation for the disabled rider. ‚Ä¢ Empowering the Disabled Robotic technology is not only benefiting humans to perform and revolutionize their workplaces, but also empowering people with their disabilities through assistive innovations. Today there are lots of apps and gadgets to ease the difficulties people with the disability face daily. Meanwhile, organizations are developing joint strategies to improve utility services, with the common goals of extending their access for all the group of people, enhancing the efficiency of delivery, and reviewing tariffs. Tech Innovations Utilities and Blockchain: Simple Applications Promising Great Results! Improving utilities with the help of blockchain technology holds vast potential. Here is how blockchain enables better management and distribution. Few Electric Utilities Companies: CTC Global, G&W Electric, MultiTech The utility sector is always on the look-out for innovative solutions. With fluctuating demands and supplies, transforming sources of energy and a rising concern for environmental impacts, the industry faces numerous challenges. Blockchain technology has answers that can help make utilities better. Many companies in the utility sector are trying and testing blockchain while some have already implemented the technology. There are many advantages associated with a blockchain, and they can be successfully translated into potential utility offerings. ‚Ä¢ Simpler Energy Trading between Peers The concept of energy sharing is catching up with the general public. Every time consumers feed energy back into the grid, they can earn some money. The process of transactions associated with the transfer of energy is simplified if blockchain technology is applied. Even while sourcing locally produced renewable energy, the transaction with blockchain makes costs lesser. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts allow real-time monitoring of production and flow data. Hence, energy exchange becomes convenient and cost-effective with blockchains. ‚Ä¢ Balancing Supply and Demand As non-conventional and renewable sources of energy take over conventional power, there is a lot of disparity in demand and supply. To attain a balance between the demands from consumers and the possible supply, smart and flexible services are necessary. Blockchain can be deployed to help consumers adjust their demands according to the energy available through temporary interruptions and intelligent management of batteries.

Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¶when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich. Achieving agility with technology reminds me of this story. Often what is needed is to give up the tools we want to use and to rely on something more basic, more fundamental. And we are so, so rich in tools and frameworks these days ‚Äî the choice seems unending. I worked with a team recently who were using Serverless (the framework, not just the architecture). Their rationale was good, and the framework itself is an awesome piece of kit. The team I was working with wanted to use it to deploy an API and an application into a VPC integrating with external JSON and SOAP-based APIs. Deployment used a typical CI/CD pipeline. The Serverless framework leverages serverless technologies, like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to automagically deploy applications consisting of pay-per-execution functions into production. It builds on infrastructure-as-code concepts to ensure that you can repeatedly deploy your stack into production without manual configuration. I like it. It‚Äôs very handy. Single command deploy ‚Äî nice. The downside to this flexibility is‚Ä¶ well you have to run a single command to deploy it. The teams‚Äô solution, designed by a very senior technical resource in the organisation, was to spin up an EC2 instance (a sort of bastion), download the code, run the single command, deploy the serverless app, then teardown the EC2 instance again. Bizarre but true ‚Äî create an ephemeral virtual server to deploy a serverless application. This works well, is performant and cost effective. If I recall correctly, the creation of this EC2 instance was orchestrated using a terraform script, which, again, takes the heavy lifting out of creating the necessary resources. That in turn was kicked off using a bash script running in a Circle CI container. I‚Äôm glossing over some essential details here, like ensuring the correct IAM credentials exist and that provisioned resources are versioned in a way that can be tracked ‚Äî built into the Serverless framework paradigm. The thing is, just a few months earlier, I had worked with a different team on a similarly spec‚Äôd app deployed in a similar scenario which was missing almost all of these moving pieces. There was still a Circle CI container to kick off builds, but deployment was basically just: This seemed to work just fine ‚Äî no terraform, no Serverless framework, no bastion EC2 instance. It left me wondering if I was missing a trick. Was there some benefit to the extra hops that I was missing? Was it just over-engineering? When choosing the technology, this simpler solution was designed to avoid as many tools as possible in order to allow more junior engineers to wrap their heads around it. I also have a friend who publishes Twitch analytics and is very successful at what he does. He uses very basic technologies, very effectively, to produce a product which is beneficial to a large community of users at almost no cost, and with a very small investment of time. I am in awe of his ability to be useful to the world. I‚Äôve seen countless people (yup, me too) fail to produce working software despite having far more financial, technical and human resources at their disposal. Why is it so hard to be effective sometimes? When we have so many tools at our disposal, why is it sometimes so hard to do good work? What does it take to have truly agile technologies? What are the different types of agility we might be interested in achieving? Why do we employ ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù processes to achieve agility but neglect to ensure we are building agile solutions?

https://medium.com/@lkcyber/interrogating-the-future-of-digital-democracies-6710fe0b2407?source=tag_archive---------95-----------------------,Interrogating the Future of Digital Democracies,Written by Dr. Lydia Kostopoulos,Dr. Lydia Kostopoulos,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dr. Lydia Kostopoulos Follow -- Listen Share [Originally published in the Observer Research Foundation ‚ÄòDigital Debates‚Äô CyFy Journal 2019 and at ORF] Democratic governance is one of the oldest forms of political governance, dating back to 507 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece. Most people believe that since then, democracy has only flourished. The reality is that ‚Äòancient democracy‚Äô collapsed; first into anarchy and then into dictatorship, heralding the medieval period, also known as the dark ages. When the United States of America declared itself a sovereign nation in 1776 (1776‚Äì1789) and ratified its new government, it was the first ‚Äòmodern democracy‚Äô. Near simultaneously on the other side of the Atlantic, the French revolution overthrew the monarchy to establish a republic with liberal democratic values. Both countries experienced violent political periods a few decades after becoming democracies and have grown into their form of governance over the centuries since their forming. Today, the United States and France are liberal democracies that continue to uphold democratic values, human rights and maintain their commitment to the political freedom of their citizens. This is not without struggle, because democracy is messy and it is a constant dialogue between citizens and their elected leaders. Citizens demand that their many voices be heard, that actions be taken in support of different interest groups, and that elected leaders be held accountable. Democracy is naturally messy because it is meant to represent an entire nation of people who think differently and want different policies from their leaders. Liberal democracies are the preferred choice of government for those who wish to elect their leaders and, no matter the outcome, experience a peaceful transition of power. It is the preferred choice for those who wish to be able to live free from prosecution because of the gender they love, the god they pray to (or don‚Äôt believe in), as well as for women to freely have access to civic liberties (and have a space to defend them) such as the pursuit of independence in all its forms (economic freedom, political participation, professional choice, reproductive rights and sexual consent). Over 2,500 years after the birth of democracy in Ancient Greece, and just a few hundred years after its resurgence at the end of the medieval times, we are transitioning into a ‚Äòdigital democracy‚Äô. We are toddlers in this new period, learning how to walk in the digital spaces of an intangible territorial sovereignty, where the digital borders are blurry but play a role on the democratic infrastructure inside physical borders. What does it mean if most of a nation‚Äôs time is spent in digital spaces? Their mind and attention is in these digital spaces, while their physical bodies are in the territorial sovereignty of a nation‚Äôs government. Digital spaces for work, love, shopping, hobbies, and religion can all be found online. Over the years, the platforms that facilitate these exchanges reached across borders to become the glue for social and professional networking, they have provided access to business markets for a new wave of digital ‚Äòmom and pop‚Äô shops, and have documented our lives in ways that generations of royalty have never experienced. These digital technologies, combined with the pervasiveness of corporate algorithms, have created a social and economic infrastructure that has increasingly taken power away from government as more citizens sign onto terms and conditions of the platforms they digitally inhabit. While this has taken away layers of bureaucracy in some aspects, it has brought more power to individuals to deliver their messages to broader audiences, sell their products to larger markets, learn new skills for free through many digital mediums, enjoy more forms of digital entertainment and connect with like-minded people across the world. However, as the spaces we inhabit (with our attention) have shifted from physical to digital, we have entered the sovereignty of those digital spaces, and their respective algorithms, which have increasingly become the mediators of our lives. They suggest who to date, what job to apply to, what home appliance to buy and which political candidate to vote for. In this sense, the algorithmic mediators of our lives have taken agency away from citizens, with several consequences, one being that the thoughts in our minds may not have necessarily come from there. It is unrealistic to argue that individuals should simply ‚Äòleave‚Äô these platforms. The costs of leaving are too high for those who rely on them for market viability and economic sustenance. Some say it is convenience, but these platforms are also a form of liberation (for revival of ‚Äòmom and pop shops‚Äô on Instagram and Etsy and Uber). They are also a form of entrapment when there aren‚Äôt other platform options. Opting out can have financial, professional and social consequences. In this space, unelected leadership and corporate policies are the de facto form of civil law online. How do liberal democracies around the world exercise their authority inside their physical territory, when the hearts and minds of their citizens residing in that same soil are living digital lives (for the most part of their day) under another leadership‚Äôs terms and rules. If liberal democracies are meant to be ‚Äúfor the people, by the people‚Äù, then the corporate jurisdictions in which we inhabit most of our digital lives are ‚Äúfor the corporation (and its shareholders), by the founders, mediated by a small group of engineers and defined by lawyers protecting corporate interests‚Äù. None of these people are democratically accountable to the citizens of any nation because they have never been elected in democratic elections. While citizens vote in government elections to determine who will govern them in the physical space, unelected leaders govern the digital spaces we spend time in, and they are playing an important role in the new fabric of our digital governance. Does democracy exist in the digital world if no one elected those who govern it? Does democracy exist in the digital world if no one elected those who control the main platforms of our digital lives, or write the algorithms that play a role in our fate? What does that mean for the role of those who are democratically elected in the physical spaces we inhabit? What does it mean to have an ‚Äúinformed‚Äù civic debate in these circumstances? When democratic representation in the physical world does not apply to the digital world, the laws as they stand are not fit for purpose. *** Dr. Lydia Kostopoulos (@Lkcyber) consults on the intersection of people, strategy, technology, education, and national security.

Amir Safavi Nayini, an assistant professor at Stanford University along with a team of researchers at the university, has devised a quantum microphone that can detect the smallest sound or vibration packets called phonons or phonetic energy quantum. The achievement provides the background for more efficient quantum computers. Previously it was impossible to track phonons because traditional microphones were not sensitive enough to detect them. When a sound wave hits a membrane, the microphone detects it. But phonons are very small and cannot be tracked alone. Instead of relying on acoustic wave measurements, scientists have devised a device that measures the energy of phonons directly using very small resonators that act as a mirror for sound. For a brief review of Iran‚Äôs achievements in various fields of science and technology, check the book ‚ÄúScience and Technology in Iran: A Brief Review ‚Äî 2019‚Äù A resonator is a device or system that displays a resonance or resonance reaction. It can capture photons and detect the vibrations they emit. The device is described in an article in the ‚ÄúNature‚Äù journal. It is a step towards the invention of a new kind of quantum computer. The traceability of tiny particles enables devices to encrypt information using acoustic energy. This way, large amounts of information can be stored in small machines. A phonon quantum computer is much more compact and efficient than a quantum computer that uses photons or light particles because phonons can be manipulated more easily than photons. More information can also be stored in less space. ‚ÄúPhotons are now being used for encryption,‚Äù says Safavi. ‚ÄúWe want to use phonons that have more advantages.

The slightly longer answer is ‚Äî there are plenty of devices and systems which do a great job and do what is needed, and the area of devices which I am interested in is those which affect people on a personal level, consumer facing devices. Read on for the elaborated answer ‚Äî which, by the way, is very open to debate! Please feel free to contact me at hello@vanessacarpenter.com or in the comments on Medium. During a workshop at Respond Festival , some questions which I have heard before began to arise. Sometimes people have created services, which get you from point a to point b; or maybe they‚Äôve made a device such as a water sensor to detect when there is a leak in your home. There are many examples of useful, functional and even necessary devices which do not need to consider meaningfulness. Let‚Äôs take the example of the water sensor. FIBARO makes such a water sensor: https://www.fibaro.com/en/products/flood-sensor/ It has all the expected bells and whistles. It notifies you and sounds an alarm if there is water detected, it can control floor heating and can be coupled to a smart valve to turn off a valve if a leak is detected. If I think about the Mechanics of Meaningfulness, it does fit some of the characteristics ‚Äî namely, identity, being someone who has taken precautions to take care of their home; value over function, the function is to detect water, but the value is in the security of knowing your home will be okay when the valve is automatically shut off in case of a leak, or that you will receive a notification if there is a storm and water is flooding in. However, these are not necessarily personal aspects. It has some level of comforting, reassurance, but it is not helping you develop as a person, to deepen your relationships with others, or to build towards a life of fulfilment. This is what I mean when I am talking about Designing for Meaningfulness. It‚Äôs not to say that this is not a meaningful product ‚Äî again, the terminology of ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô, ‚Äòmeaningfulness‚Äô and a ‚Äòmeaningful life‚Äô is to say the least, complicated. And furthermore, a product can be quite meaningful, it can save you thousands of dollars if you can do something about water damage before it gets too far, or if you can have a valve automatically shut off when there is a problem. That‚Äôs meaningful. It saves time, money and definitely headaches. The kind of meaningful I am speaking about however, is on a much more personal level. Let‚Äôs take another example. I recently came across the Willow breast pump. https://shop.willowpump.com/ This is a wearable breast pump, which is discreet, wireless, and is described as ‚Äú The first all-in-one wearable breast pump. Mobile. Quiet. Spill-Proof. Trusted. Willow fits inside your bra, and into your schedule. ‚Äú. Now, to be clear, I do not have children. I haven‚Äôt experienced the pain, shame, suffering, and frustration that my friends have described when trying to pump breast milk whilst trying to keep up with the daily circus of having children, a home and a career ‚Äî or any combination thereof. To me, the Willow breast pump sounds like an amazing solution. And judging from their testimonials, it is working wonders ‚Äî or rather, allowing women to work wonders. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt directly help you develop as a person, or does it? If we are speaking about the Mechanic: Personal Development then doesn‚Äôt it address identity: career woman / mother? Or Meaningfulness in the Everyday ‚Äî being able to go about your day and not worry about finding a private place to pump breast milk, where you won‚Äôt be disturbed or disturb others? (Maybe not so much a problem here in Denmark where we have a year‚Äôs maternity leave, and many public spaces have breast feeding rooms, but definitely a problem in some other countries). It definitely speaks to Value over Function, the function is to extract and store milk, but the value is allowing a woman to do what she both needs and wants to do without the typical hassle associated with pumping milk. So does it help with personal development? I would argue yes, indirectly, it allows for a woman to be who she wants to be, to work if she wants to, or to participate in activities, or to be free of a complicated, loud machine. Does it help with relationships? Yes again, I‚Äôd say yes ‚Äî you can socialize, you can work, you can schedule your life as you would like to. So this is perhaps a great example of Designing for Meaningfulness ‚Äî an indirect example, the device itself is not necessarily pushing for you to work on self development or to develop relationships but it allows you to do those things. I encounter people making all kinds of devices: industry 4.0 monitoring solutions, smart home products, medical devices, children‚Äôs toys, the list goes on. Sometimes, Designing for Meaningfulness will be useful, as a thinking experiment, or as part of the design process itself. Other times, a company might just need a product which measures a parameter and delivers clear numbers. As a result of my research for presentations, I‚Äôve been looking more and more into sustainability. I cover some of this in my dissertation, the tendency to design for obsolescence and how many academics are working to combat this, and how some companies are also looking for more sustainable solutions. Recently, when I presented Designing for Meaningfulness, I had someone come up afterwards and say how important this work was (thank you!) for their domain. They work in construction and explained about how much waste there is in building sites. I won‚Äôt get into the details, but suffice to say, even though they are not designing for self or interpersonal development, they could still see how utilizing critical thinking, or considering the value over function, or designing for the long term would be beneficial to them. This is a very brief post ‚Äî but one which I hope answers the question, do all devices need to facilitate meaningfulness? Nope. Your car keys will open your car, all and any contextually derived meaning resulting from that experience is entirely up to you. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that we shouldn‚Äôt be focused on how we might Design for Meaningfulness in other areas, or at the very least, ask ourselves if it is something we might consider when ideating new products.

Have you heard tech terms like frontend, backend or API? Well, those are essential components of every web application. The front end is what you see; the backend is the hidden engine that powers every action of your visual interface. API is a connector in between those two which allows them to communicate. It‚Äôs a set of clearly defined methods, definitions and routines how apps communicate with each other. GraphQL is a query language to describe an API So far REST API was the most popular standard of creating API‚Äôs. GraphQL was introduced in 2015 by Facebook as an alternative to REST. Back then It wasn‚Äôt just an experiment ‚Äî it was already in production inside facebook mobile apps since 2012. Just after public release, It became extremely popular, and around that time many companies were working on similar solutions. This technology started to gain attention since it can be used with many other languages and there‚Äôre many ready to go libraries to most popular styles. Right now according to Stackshare there‚Äôre nearly 2k companies using it. Early adopters included Coursera, Github, ProductHunt, Yelp or Twitter. GraphQL from its core name is something more than new API standard. Some users describe it as a tool for the specification of new solutions. Thanks to graph sourcing we can visualise existing database schema and show existing solutions on the screen. From the other side, you can prototype new business applications. With visualised graph possibilities are endless. Think about the potential advantages of giving access to internal systems for a business manager at company meeting or speeding up onboarding of new developers. Some companies have significant and complex systems; therefore it slows down digital transformation. Check below how Github‚Äôs schema in action. GraphQL is easy to learn. You have to learn 15‚Äì20 definitions to start understanding it. Not joking! Check below a list of the most important ones. Don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by too many definitions at the start. Start by checking object type ‚Äî in definition is a group of fields. Basic type definitions Graphql is strongly typed, which means that each definition must have a particular type. The Type System comes with the help, which provides several possibilities for defining elements of our API. Another exciting thing about strongly typed is the visual part. The most important feature of GraphQL for business users is that it‚Äôs language agnostic. It‚Äôs not created to work with a specific technology. It‚Äôs a query language with its own rules which for most popular programming languages. There‚Äôre many supportive libraries on the internet for C#/.NET, PHP. Javascript, Java, Python, Ruby and many more. Therefore learning a little bit of schema definition language, you‚Äôre able to communicate with all kind of developers. GraphQL is flexible and efficient. In traditional REST approach developers had to send many requests to show data on one screen. It‚Äôs not super efficient when it comes to mobile apps ‚Äî it slows them down and needs more internet data transfer. GraphQL allows a user to create only one endpoint and get exactly required data. Thanks to technology introduced by Facebook engineers communication between client and a server is better optimised. That‚Äôs the power of GraphQL ‚Äî flexibility. You don‚Äôt need to create endpoints for different screens. Various clients can use a once defined schema in a way that they need to.

https://medium.com/zinklar-tech/monitoring-kubernetes-2f59ab7a9af2?source=tag_archive---------84-----------------------,Monitoring Kubernetes,Dashboards,Albert Navas,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Albert Navas Follow Zinklar Tech -- Listen Share Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for applications and is oriented to the microservices architecture using containers. When we have a lot of services, traffic between them and incoming connections‚Ä¶ we need to be sure that everything is optimised to prevent overloads and to detect potential problems. When we work with an autoscaling configuration we need to monitor these changes in order to make sure that we have enough resources, among other elements. There are a lot of monitoring tools on the market. In this article, we are going to approach Kubernetes, on Google Cloud Platform. Kubernetes on GCP shows some metrics on its dashboards, such as cluster nodes, deployments, pods, and services. For each of them, we can see the CPU, Memory and Disk Usage. This may be enough to start with, but when the infrastructure grows and you need more control over what is happening on your system, you need to implement other tools. Now I‚Äôm going to describe some useful tools for this purpose and how we can combine them to reach our goals. Prometheus is a monitoring platform that collects metrics from third-party systems. There are a lot of integrations. A complete list can be found here: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/ With Prometheus, we can create alerts for any metric or we can expose these metrics to other services on port 9090, as we will see later. StackDriver provides monitoring on the Kubernetes infrastructure. This service is from Google and is available to everybody on GCP. We can connect Kubernetes to StackDriver enabling the option ‚ÄúStackDriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring‚Äù on our cluster. Now we‚Äôll see a lot of metrics that Google provides as default. StackDriver uses Prometheus to get the metrics from our cluster automatically. Now we can create dashboards with the exact parameters that we need and share them easily. It‚Äôs possible to create alerts from our dashboards and even create custom metrics from our logs. This last option is very useful as we can have direct metrics of our services‚Äô behaviour. Istio is a service mesh that allows us to connect, secure, control, and observe services within the Kubernetes infrastructure. It provides us with metrics from our services. Prometheus pulls the metrics from Istio and displays them. Then we can create alerts from these metrics on Prometheus or we can use another platform like Grafana to do this. Istio also provides is the possibility to encrypt communications between services, ingress and egress rules, a cluster gateway and much more. Grafana is an observability platform that pulls metrics from other services. To pull the metrics we need to add a data source. It can be for example, Prometheus, PostgreSQL, StackDriver, ElasticSearch‚Ä¶ Grafana allows us to create dashboards to display the metrics with beautiful graphics. We can use dashboards built by the community or official providers. Go to the Dashboards->Manage section and click the Import button. Here you can provide a JSON with the dashboard information or the ID of a dashboard from https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards Then you‚Äôll have to provide additional information, such as name, folder, Prometheus data source, etc. depending on the dashboard. With Grafana we can create alerts for each of the metrics and send them to different channels. Channels include email, Slack, Telegram, PagerDuty, VictorOps, etc. To create an alert, go to the dashboard and click Edit on the graph you want to create the alert for. Then click on the bell icon on the left panel and click on the Create Alert button. Here you can specify the parameters of the alert you want to create. Then you can select the notifications parameters. This is a difficult part of the process. We have to try to identify the critical components of our system and think about how we can track them. We can start monitoring these attributes: We have to check if the cluster and workloads are up and running. This can be done through metrics or health endpoints on our apps. We need to monitor the cluster‚Äôs resources, which are usually CPU, memory and I/O traffic. We need to be sure that we have enough resources to run our applications without performance issues and that we have enough resources if the workloads need to scale. Istio can provide all of these performance metrics. Prometheus is the core of our monitoring, complemented with Grafana for Dashboards and Alerts. There are a lot of tools and services that can be used to set up your monitoring system. The approach explained here works for us but we recommend that you always try to adapt the tools to your needs, depending on how your system has been built. -- -- At Zinklar we eat, sleep and breathe Market Research.

As we get older, we finally know that all the assets owned by our parents come from the efforts they make so that we realize how important a business must be to gain profitability in life. Many types of businesses that can be done by someone to fill their financial coffers, one of which became the target of the acquisition of the general public is trading. This type of business is considered as a business that provides bright opportunities like the future and has an independent nature where a trader can regulate the ups and downs of the trading situation that they do without having to be bound by the rules of the leadership that are sometimes different from one‚Äôs will. In the world of Blockchain technology as it is today, trading activities have been carried out in modern ways. Unlike past forms of trade where everyone has to find the right location in various market lands to build their shops and must guard it from morning to night, now trading has been done through the digital world where everyone is free to choose the location of their stores even exist which makes their private room their land for sale and every item they sell will be posted on various e-commerce sites to further obtain orders from their customers. Along with the development of Blockchain technology, various crypto currencies such as BTC, ETH and DOGE were born which are widely used by people in making payment transactions for the trades they run so that traders today are highly demanded to have a platform that can store and transact all types of crypto currencies given the rampant use of cryptocurrency today. For this reason the XCard platform was created. XCard is a Blockchain technology for payment and transaction crypto currency that is useful in handling the management of trade transactions conducted by someone. Every user can send or receive money instantly wherever and whenever they want. And the good news, traders who use this platform can receive payments from all customers in crypto or fiat currencies so they don‚Äôt need to worry about the limited currency payments they will receive from the sales they have made. Every trader who has joined this platform will be given a wallet called XWallet in the form of a smartphone application that can be downloaded via Playstore for android users and Appstore for Iphone users. XWallet is an XCard multi-asset wallet which supports more than 150 types of fiat currencies from various countries in the world where traders can conduct financial transactions on their crypto and fiat currencies here. traders can also exchange their crypto currencies with fiat currency or vice versa on this wallet. With the presence of this wallet in the middle of the digital market share provides an installation service for digital traders around the world. In addition to the privileges provided by XCard for traders through the ‚ÄúAll In One‚Äù wallet, this platform also provides a credit card called the XCard Credit Card that can be used as a crypto or fiat currency transaction tool at various ATMs around the world. Users are provided with ease in the form of easy access to this card where users can use this card as a means of depositing money and payment instruments in any E-commerce and can also be used for cash withdrawals in cash withdrawals machines anywhere as we have mentioned before. The Xcard credit card that has the same principles as XWallet is a debit card that has used the VISA Logo. VISA is the name of a company providing financial authorization services that has operated in various countries in almost all continents in the world. Credit cards that have been certified by this company are considered an appropriate tool and to be used for various activities in the banking world because this company guarantees every security from various companies that have worked together as partners. Therefore, it is very appropriate for traders to choose XCard as their trust platform.

According to the IDC, global IoT spending will increase by 15.4 percent in 2019, with US$100 billion going to manufacturing; while insurance, the federal government, and healthcare will see the fastest investment growth. The forecast provided by the consultancy Nerdery is similar: healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and local city councils will see a broad range of rapid IoT applications. There is a clear trend to leverage IoT technology to connect devices and bring data online, then use artificial intelligence technology to do proactive mitigation, risk management, and efficiency improvement. It is a clear path, but based on past experiences, it is still very challenging in implementation, and will likely require one of the industry giants to finish building an end-to-end implementation platform and show clear monetary value.

The company announced a low-interest credit card, a TV streaming service, and the long-awaited Apple News+. Even with the ludicrous 50 percent tax Apple levies on publishers, the potential ubiquity (read: 1 billion iPhones) of Apple News+ makes it about as close to a potential savior of journalism as the free market has the ability to create.

We‚Äôre the EV MythBusters!,Shirin Sonali,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shirin Sonali Follow Orxa Energies -- Listen Share In this article, we are taking head-on the biggest reason why many people hesitate to go Electric: Range! There are many parts to the misunderstandings surrounding Range. Let‚Äôs break down the big ones here: Since at Orxa Energies, we work on fully-electric performance motorcycles, and since they comprise 80% of vehicles on Indian roads, let‚Äôs focus on two-wheelers (2Ws). There‚Äôs a wide range of Electric 2Ws and they vary according to types (scooter or motorcycle); weight (typically ranges from 80kg to 200kg); battery pack size (typically 1.5 units to 5 units)*; and motor power (typically from 0.25kW to 50kW). *(1 unit = 1 kWh/kilowatt hour) Let‚Äôs start with the basics first. What exactly is Range? It‚Äôs not much different from the mileage of a fuel-powered vehicle. Just like mileage is the distance traveled per liter of fuel, the range of an EV is the total distance driven on one full charge of the battery pack. And just like the mileage of an ICE, the Range of an EV is also affected by circumstantial & environmental changes, such as city vs. highway, road conditions, age of the vehicle, operating temperatures, etc. However, the reasons for worry are different. In the case of ICEs, we worry about mileage because of the cost of fuel. In the case of EVs, people worry about Range because they ‚Äòmight get stranded‚Äô* far away from a charge point. *(which is not true for 75‚Äì87% of the cases as per many studies ‚Äî but more on this below) Before we start to debunk the myths on ‚ÄúRange Claimed‚Äù, we need to look first at how the range of EVs is calculated. What do companies mean by efficiency, and how we can verify if their claimed ranges are realistic? Let‚Äôs start with some basics ‚Äî the standards. There are 2 basic standards ‚Äî Indian Drive Cycle (IDC) and Urban Drive Cycle (UDC). The Indian Drive Cycle is the official drive cycle used to determine efficiency/mileage. The other one, which some EV companies have begun to use, is the Artemis Urban Drive Cycle (UDC), which simulates city riding conditions better with multiple accelerations, braking, etc. Most 2W ICE companies quote mileage based on IDC and hence the promised 80 km/liter and 100 km/liter for scooters and motorcycles respectively are never achieved. Similarly, many EV companies quote the range only on the basis of IDC, resulting in the range being quoted as unrealistically high. There are many assumptions that go into this IDC range calculations. Some of them are: Single rider of average weight (70 kgs) riding, No pillion or significant extra luggage, Rides on mostly plain roads (no flyovers or underpasses, etc.), ideal temperatures, and so on‚Ä¶ Looking at these assumptions, I bet you get a good idea why ‚Äúreal‚Äù ranges on-road differ so much from the IDC range! So if we‚Äôre riding with a pillion or heavy luggage, or riding aggressively with rapid accelerations & braking, or if the road has a lot of altitude changes, the IDC range quoted in the vehicle‚Äôs marketing material is not going to be achieved. Myth 1 ‚Äî Busted! Range anxiety is the fear that a vehicle has insufficient range to reach its destination and would thus strand the vehicle‚Äôs occupants. Think about your college days, when you‚Äôd fill petrol in your borrowed scooter for a 100 rupees, and desperately hope it would last you through your date? All the route calculations you did to make sure the 100 Rs of petrol lasted? Range Anxiety is similar. Except that right now, Charge / Swap stations aren‚Äôt as common as the Petrol station around the corner from your college. So does that mean you can‚Äôt even think of buying an EV until there are charge stations everywhere?? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Over the lifetime of a vehicle, 2W EVs are already cheaper to own & run than petrol 2Ws! Don‚Äôt believe us? Let‚Äôs get Math to help us! As an example, imagine a 90kg scooter with a battery pack of about 2.75kWh in Bangalore city. Such a vehicle would have a range of 110km expected on IDC. In terms of money spent to charge, with a 2.75kWh battery, we can assume to be spending about 3.2 units of electricity in the least, which is around INR 19. With this, if we get 90 km in city riding (since city riding is not IDC), we‚Äôd spend about 21 paise/km. For the same 90 km in a petrol 2W, we‚Äôd spend about 1.5 to 2 Rs /km, even at best mileage. Apart from this, there‚Äôs less maintenance, servicing, etc!! (source: article 1, article 2 ) ‚ÄúCustomers are now realizing that TCO of EVs is far less than the ICE vehicles. A petrol scooter runs at Rs 2/ km against Rs 0.30/km for an electric scooter, saving Rs 1.7/ km.‚Äù (Source) If that isn‚Äôt enough to convince you, 75% of all of us in Indian cities commute less than 35 Kms a day (Source). This is well within the range offered by most 2W EVs. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways floating an ‚Äúexpression of interest‚Äù for setting up 1,000 charging stations with 6,000 chargers across all big cities. On a broader scale, the government wants to set up charging stations every three km in all the cities with a million-plus population (46 cities) and every 50 km on highways. The demand from this alone would be around 30,000 slow and 15,000 fast-charging points over the next five years. (Source: Link) 75% of Urban Indian Commuters travel less than 35kms/day! Myth 2 ‚Äî Busted! So can you ‚Äòchange the range‚Äô you get out of your EV? Yes, you can! The distance an EV can travel before needing a recharge could be shortened by a number of factors. And some of these are within your control ‚Äî yes, your control! Myth 3 ‚Äî Busted?!?! (Understanding these issues will take a lot more time ‚Äî we‚Äôll cover more of this in later blogs!) There are a number of Myths & Misunderstandings around Electric Vehicles. EVs are still a new(-ish) technology & these misunderstandings lead to poor adoption. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should not switch to EVs! On the contrary! EfficiencyElectric Vehicles are already more efficient than Petrol or Diesel vehicles in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. (72% against 15% or 20% efficiency respectively). Regenerative braking in EVs, as we talked about above, can recover as much as one-fifth of the energy normally lost during braking. CostAdd to this the lower cost of electricity versus petrol or diesel per kilometre. Combine this with the lesser number of moving parts in an EV, leading to lesser breakdowns and servicing costs (no oil change for ex!) Range required 75% of Indian commuters commute only about 35 kms a day. Any EV meeting this range requirement will hence be sufficient to convert 75% of vehicles on road to EVs! Combine this with the fact that consumer vehicles are parked 80 to 90% of the day and hence this time can be used to slow charge these EVs at home, office, malls, etc. But a number of misunderstandings still remain regarding EVs. Poor product offerings in the Indian EV market also add to the potential EV customer‚Äôs woes & confusion (Is the 200+km range claim ‚Äòreal‚Äô? Can it pull up a flyover? Will the battery actually last or do I have pay in 1 year for another set?). We hope we‚Äôve cleared the air around some of these myths today.

I volunteered with the first Festival of Maintenance last year and wrote about it here. At this year‚Äôs Festival, four themes stuck out to me as recurring over the diverse talks. Rather than a comprehensive summary (full talks can be found here), these are my key takeaways from the day. Maintenance work is often made invisible. We put up temporary walls in train stations, airports and museums to cordon off the offending area while a sign apologizes for the inconvenience. Maintenance is by definition a work-in-progress. It is unfinished, unready: it is not supposed to be seen. Lack of visibility leads to lack of awareness and lack of appreciation. This causes maintenance work to be undervalued and underinvested-in. Increased visibility, therefore, is the first step towards awareness, appreciation and investment. Tom van Deijnen aka Tom of Holland presented this theme most explicitly with his Visible Mending Programme. Tom does textile repair and runs workshops through which he hopes to inspire others to mend clothes. In his work he often makes patches and mends stand out visually, part of his invitation to ‚Äòwear a darn as a badge of honour.‚Äô Donna Young, curator of the herbarium at the World Museum in Liverpool, is a specialist in ‚Äòkeeping dead things dead.‚Äô She took us behind the scenes of preserved collections of the museum, explaining how when their wing of the museum was being renovated they had to freeze the entire collection bit by bit to prevent infestations. Exposing the hidden work of maintenance is very much in line with Katrine Mar√ßal‚Äôs ‚ÄòWho Cooked Adam Smith‚Äôs Dinner?‚Äô (The answer is his mother.) I recently came across this wonderful piece about how Henry David Thoreau, for all his talk of radical independence, relied on his friends and family doing his laundry or having him over for dinner. A few talks demonstrated how beyond the actual maintenance itself there may be even further hidden labours of research and analysis. A driver passing a pothole day after day may understandably moan ‚ÄúJust fix it!‚Äù Potholes are an old and familiar problem, but not one that has been solved. There are so many contributing factors from materials to weather to how the road was built or repaired that no one knows exactly how they should best be treated. Mujib Rahman works on precisely this problem, not out on motorways but in his lab with a team of graduate students doing tests and modelling to figure out exactly how potholes can best be repaired. Edward Saul, a civil engineer, turned our attention to the nearby Churchill Way flyover, a post-tensioned bridge (if I‚Äôve got that right‚Ä¶) in the process of being demolished. Saul explained to the audience of mostly non-engineer civilians how invasive procedures were required just to check on the state of the bridge. Developments in technology now mean that similar bridges can be built with access for maintenance checks as well as observing by drone or connecting the bridges with smart sensors. I often see artists and other creatives on social media expose and protest against seemingly frequent requests that they work for free. Like creative work, maintenance is often done as a passion project and for free. We should celebrate those who do so but it would be a mistake to ignore that maintenance does require significant investment of time and resources. The fact maintainers often do their labour pro bono should be seen as a symptom of a lack of investment rather than a solution. Ben Ward spoke frankly about the real need for networks of support and sustenance. Ben started an initiative called Flood Network to monitor water levels with DIY-style sensors across the UK. They‚Äôve got a working system but a limited number of customers and investment mean the project is mostly a hobby for Ben. There are equipment costs (buying sensors) and labour costs (installing and maintaining those sensors). The fact that information is stored on the cloud doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cheap either ‚Äî Ben showed how his cloud storage costs exploded and how digital infrastructures must be maintained. Both Professor Rahman and Tom Forth of the Open Data Institute Leeds opened their talks with non-perfunctory thanks to their sponsors and collaborators. Tom called attention to the fact people are free to take open data and make money based on it. Ventures that make money are ventures that can sustain themselves and even expand into new endeavours. Jeni Tennison, CEO of the Open Data Institute, spoke about the benefits of opening up a digital archive to collaborative maintenance (which they‚Äôve written a report on). When the number of contributors can be exponentially greater, when the base of contributors is distributed, has diverse skills and experiences, the result is drastically increased speed and accuracy. Jeni gave as an example the effort to keep an online record of all UK legislation up to date. A dedicated team working in a closed off way resulted in a database that was out of date and getting worse every year. Opening the maintenance of the archive to include lawyers, students and private sector contributors not only brought the database up to date but allowed additional categories to be catalogued. Obviously in this case the fact that the archive was digital meant it could be worked on at scale and that rules could be written to govern how contributions took place and were monitored. Mia Ridge, digital curator of Western Heritage Collections at the British Library and a specialist in crowdsourcing, knows about the benefits of scale that digital brings. But she also brought up many challenges familiar from the offline world. We cannot in reality keep everything, so we must choose what to keep or not. Websites and files do break over time. The creators or maintainers of digital systems leave the organisation, taking their tacit knowledge and care with them. In this light, the maintenance of digital objects starts to look very similar to that of physical objects. Indy Rojar mentioned, not going in-depth, that the digital revolution should bring organisational overhead to near zero. A counterpoint, perhaps, was brought up by Chris Adams. Digital infrastructure in fact consumes a massive amount of energy. Google‚Äôs carbon footprint, which comes mostly from keeping servers up and running, is equal to that of Liberia. And as Ben Ward pointed out in his talk, storing data is far from cheap and these costs can prove an insurmountable challenge for a self-funded initiative. Shannon Mattern‚Äôs talk was titled ‚ÄòDecoupling and the Maintenance Mindset‚Äô. I was struck by the phrase ‚Äòmaintenance mindset‚Äô ‚Äî what is it? Is it a philosophy? A way of life? Perhaps the closest parallel would be the concept of stewardship: the obligation to care for our things, our machines, ourselves, each other and the earth in a way that is sustainable in the long-term, with a focus on keeping diverse forms of life and objects around. Mattern focused on the synergies between the maintenance mindset and the decoupling or degrowth movement. Other speakers, when asked during Q&A, were hesitant to jump on the tag of degrowth ‚Äî they mostly wanted to stress how growth can be done sensibly and sustainably. I suspect there would have been little disagreement, however, with Shannon‚Äôs summary of the movement as not ‚Äúagainst growth, per se; it calls, instead, for a critique of growth as an end in itself.‚Äù Indy Rojar of Dark Matter Labs challenged the audience to engage with systemic structures or risk failing to make the changes required for a true maintenance mindset. He calls this the ‚Äòboring revolution‚Äô in bureaucracy, governance, financing and social norms. Indy refers to this as innovation in the ‚Äòdeep code‚Äô that structures daily life. Taking the Highline in New York as one example Indy suggested we reconsider the concept of land value from something intrinsic to the land itself to something largely derived from proximity of access to public goods ‚Äî schools, parks, means of transportation, economic opportunity, and so on. The need for drastic change and new ways of thinking and acting in the face of climate change was acknowledged repeatedly over the course of the day. The ‚Äòmaintenance mindset‚Äô clearly necessitates a more careful and conscious relationship to the world around us in order to ensure that both we and it can continue to exist in the long term.

People around the globe can now reserve an equal share of XNOS. The process is simple. One only has to look on social media for an invite link and can sign-up for NOS Initiative. The Initial sign-up gets everyone 10 XNOS and sharing a custom referral gets everyone an additional 10 XNOS for every person that signs-up using the link. We have capped the distribution at 100 XNOS per person or 120 XNOS if early KYC is performed. Each person will have to eventually KYC before the distribution starts. This is simply necessary due to the frequent airdrop abuse and manipulation that some people attempt. *The NOS project does not forward the data to third parties. NOLLAR is the world first instant and feeless stablecoin. Meaning sending p2p transactions to other users is completely free and transfers are confirmed by the network in less than 0.5 seconds currently. This makes NOLLAR the fastest, cheapest and stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies in todays market. The vision for NOLLAR is not to counter traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Nano or Monero. The goal is simply to provide a stable currency solution to developing countries like Venezuela who currently has about a 3% monetary inflation of the Bolivar on a daily basis. Although the country is one of the richest in the world, the regular person does not see this wealth or has a way to save the little money they own. We are changing p2p value transfer, cross-border payments, settlements and much more with a superior payment solution that will bring Venezuela and other developing countries out of their misery into a new age of prosperity. The key advantage for a regular person is a stable alternative to local hyper deflationary fiat and the ability to send stable value without the need of a bank to friends, relatives, across countries in the blink of an eye. Micro-payments are the most essential part since sending small value like $1 usually brings massive fees for people when using traditional payment solutions.

The one that was praised for promoting physical activity but condemned by some governments as a security threat? Approximately 800 million people have downloaded the app, which uses a phone‚Äôs GPS ability to locate, capture, battle, and train animated creatures (Pok√©mon) that appear on the screen as if they occupied the same real-world location as the user. Pok√©mon Go is widely credited with popularizing augmented reality technology, which enhances reality when a device such as a phone or a headset overlays digital information (in the form of holograms) onto the real world. Augmented reality is different from virtual reality and different from everyday reality. In virtual reality, a person is completely immersed in a computer-generated world. In everyday reality, a person is completely in the real world. Augmented reality blends computer-generated images into the real world. Although the Pok√©mon Go craze is waning, the popularity and more serious applications of augmented reality continue to spread. Los Alamos National Laboratory is investigating the technology‚Äôs applications and writing software in support of the Laboratory‚Äôs national security mission, such as tracking inventories or giving workers instructions for using equipment on the job and in real time. Other new uses of augmented reality technology being developed at Los Alamos may save time, money, and even lives by improving procedures for structural-health monitoring. Structural-health monitoring determines the physical integrity of structures such as bridges, buildings, and dams. Current techniques are largely visual. Inspectors look for cracks or corrosion and measure their extent. The inspectors record those observations, compare them to previous years‚Äô observations, and then deem the structures safe (or not). The problem with current techniques is that often structures are so large that accurately measuring them can be difficult and time consuming. Using augmented reality, however, an inspector wearing a headset can quickly take a lot of accurate three-dimensional measurements of a structure using a headset or smartphone. More data points equals a better safety analysis. As many buildings near the end of their design lives ‚Äî their predicted life span ‚Äî augmented reality technology will become crucial to determining when and where upgrades are needed. Measurements taken using augmented reality technology can also be helpful during construction. For example, last summer, the Laboratory partnered with Los Alamos County to measure the surface area of a recently poured concrete sidewalk. The county wanted to know the sidewalk‚Äôs surface area in order to pay the contractor who did the work. Normally survey crews do these types of measurements, but the augmented reality technology was able to take accurate measurements that were faster, less expensive, and required less training for the operator. Augmented reality technology can also make structures safer for people with disabilities. Using the technology, Los Alamos County workers were able to measure the grade of a paved multiuse path. They found one section of the trail too steep to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. It had to be redone. In the future, instead of measuring structures retroactively, construction crews might make measurements on the fly and adjust their work in real time, which would be a real advantage in a society where people ‚Äî and Pok√©mon ‚Äî are constantly on the move.

Even a well-tuned and stable drone takes some skill to pilot, and traditional RC-style controllers can be overwhelming. But, what if you didn‚Äôt need a controller at all? That‚Äôs the idea behind UDrone, which you can fly with mind control. UDrone just launched on Kickstarter, and at first glance it looks like any other compact quadcopter. However, instead of flying it with a conventional controller, you pilot it with mind control through a special UMind Lite headset. The headset uses a combination of sensors to read broad changes in your brain waves, minute alterations in your facial muscles, and the movement of your head. Those readings are then used to direct the drone. To tell the drone to take off, for example, you simply think about it moving up. To make it land, you clench your teeth together. To turn it, you tilt your head. It also has a built-in subject recognition artificial intelligence system that will allow it to follow you, or to snap a picture when you blink your eyes twice or throw up a peace sign. For long range flight, you can use the included app to pilot it more like a standard drone. The drone itself fits in the palm of your hand, and only weighs 85 grams. It can fly for up to 25 minutes on a charge, and has a maximum range of 60 meters with the app. The onboard camera is capable of recording stabilized full HD video, and can take pictures up to 8MP. Through the app, you can even see real time video as you fly. The headset might look a little silly, but this drone is packing some serious technology. The UDrone Kickstarter campaign is running until April 26th, and you can get a UDrone with the UMind Lite headset for $280, or just the drone for $149. Rewards are expected to be delivered in April. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

In reality, he must have just used it as an excuse to buy one for himself. However, 25 years later, I have so far only owned Nintendo‚Äôs consoles ‚Äî years ago, we bought the Wii with my brother and for this Christmas, I bought myself the SNES Classic. As you can see, I‚Äôve not been too much of a gamer myself. So before buying the NES Classic, I also checked out other consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. All of them seemed to have their pros and cons. But I decided to go with SNES Classic as it was a cheaper way to see whether I still enjoy console games. A few months later, I see that for me a console only makes sense as a party device. Yes, there have been some occasions when I turned SNES Classic‚Äôs power on without having someone over at our place. Yet in most cases, I‚Äôve stuck to just watching some series when at home alone or with Lele and in a chill mode. That said, I really love to play tabletop games ‚Äî card games, strategy games and even simple luck-based dice games. Not always for their mechanics but because I enjoy a good old board game night with some friends around the table. Knowing all this, it seems that it does not make sense for me to own a console. Unless I can use it as a party device. So this kind of rules out professional gaming devices such as the PS4 and Xbox One. However, Nintendo Switch is different. Yes, Switch has all the capabilities of a great gaming device ‚Äî or so I have heard. But based on my short experience, it also has more. Yesterday, we were celebrating Estonia‚Äôs 101st birthday with a sauna party that was followed up with a feast and playing some games. First up, we played some Super Mario Kart on the SNES. Winning some and losing many more races‚Ä¶ But then our new Brazillian friends took out their Switch and we played some Super Smash Bros, followed by Super Mario Party. And the experience was awesome! I especially loved playing Super Mario Party because it is basically a multi-levelled board game that four of us could play at the same time. The fact that it has tens of minigames inside the big game is what I enjoyed the most. That said, I also like that one only needs to buy one extra set of Switch‚Äôs special remotes to give up to four people a chance to start enjoying the experience. An investment that‚Äôs much smaller than for other consoles. Later I discovered that The Nintendo Switch Is Quietly Becoming the Best Platform for Board Games. With our favourite tabletop games such as Catan and Munchkin soon to be released on the platform. In short, if you love playing board games then Switch seems to be something for you.

Test case naming: Name the test case to represent the module name (Functional area) which we are going to verify in test cases: Example: Project Name: XYZ Module name (Functional area): Login Instead of naming test as TC_01, we could use, ‚ÄúTC_01_XYZ_Login_Success‚Äù 2. Test case description: Defines what we are going to test? (Enter as much information as possible!) 3. Assumptions and Preconditions: We must communicate with all assumptions which applies to test, along with preconditions Example: 4. Test Data input: Identifying data is always a time consuming activity. To make your life easy as a tester (and your fellow-testers!), wherever applicable, you can give Test Data to be used for the Test Case within the test case description or with the specific Test Case step. (Very helpful in long run) Few Points: 5. Cover all Verification Points in Steps: In Test cases, we not only have to cover functional flow but also all verification points. By comparing your Test Case steps with the artifacts (Requirement documents, Use Cases, User Stories or Process Maps) given for your project, you can make sure that the Test Case optimally covers all the verification points. 6. Attach the relevant Artifacts: Wherever possible, attach the relevant artifacts in test cases. if it involves a specific section on the screen which could be tricky to mention in the test step, attaching the specification documents or screen designs 7. Expected Result: Well written test case should have expected result of Application/System under test. Each and every test case should clearly mention what we expect as outcome. Example: 1. Mention what page/screen you expect appear after test. 2. Any update you expect. (Eg: New entry should be made in Database) 8. Divide special functional test cases into sets: For effective test cases, break down test cases in sets ‚Äî subsets Example: Browser specific behaviors, Cookie verifications, checking error conditions etc.‚Ä¶ We can write separate test cases for any ‚Äúverifying error message‚Äù from ‚ÄúFunctional Test‚Äù Example: Verify any login feature.

In 1986, two decades after the surgeon general report that was a pivotal turning point in the decline of the cultural acceptance of smoking, another surgeon general report was released detailing the significant harm caused by secondhand smoke. In the years since the revelation that secondhand smoke kills, the extent of that danger has been articulated and quantified. Over 41,000 adults are subject to premature death and a stunning 400 infants lose their lives every year because of the myriad carcinogens released by cigarettes. Beyond its lethal effects, secondhand smoke is also tied to lower respiratory illnesses and can increase the severity of asthma in those who have it. These stats and others about the harms of secondhand smoke are no surprise. Our culture has used those harms in its case against smoking to enact ‚Äúsmoke-free‚Äù laws, pushing those who light up ‚Äî and their unwanted smoke ‚Äî to the fringes of society. Indeed, the well-documented harms caused by secondhand smoke as outlined in the 1986 surgeon‚Äôs general report, and the harms caused by actually smoking, form a one-two punch against smoking culture.

There is a discrepancy between the human experience of time and how it functions on a scale beyond our experience, leaving us with the questions. How much is temporality, as a neuro-chemical phenomenon, produced as a result of evolutionary expediency? And‚Ä¶ To what extent do the temporal perceptions of a sentient biological system correlate with a reality outside of that experience? We have access to time outside of human temporality through Fundamental Physics which allows us to comprehend time at scales we have no direct access to. It is this research that has enabled us to in turn develop advanced systems that themselves function on scales beyond the experiential capacities of the human (GPS, HFT for example). These systems proliferate and provide the global systemic architecture that structures much of how we now live. Xenotemporality is a conceptual tool to better understand that time is both alien to us yet we are completely enmeshed in. It intimately effects our daily lives and shifts how we understand ourselves as a force on the planet. Conceptualizing this alien-time is important to help navigate a reality that is both of our own making yet functions outside of our direct experience. For example, we do not directly experience the bending of space-time caused by Earth‚Äôs mass but we have knowledge of it, and we are able to account for it, enabling the accurate functioning of GPS systems. We, as a species, have evolved to function at a local scale but this is no longer adequate to how we organize, inflect, and orient the systems and infrastructures we rely on globally. Time is an important factor in this, in part, because of the way we have bound ourselves to the deep past and deep future via the extraction and burning of fossil fuels needed to maintain these planetary systems. We do not directly experience the bending of space-time caused by Earth‚Äôs mass but we have knowledge of it, and we are able to account for it, enabling the accurate functioning of GPS systems. We, as a species, have evolved to function at a local scale but this is no longer adequate to how we organize, inflect, and orient the systems and infrastructures we rely on globally. I am involved in ongoing research that aims to develop the concept of Xenotemporality. In the work presented here, I focus on the thinking of physicist Carlo Rovelli. Subsequent works in the series will look at a range of perspectives being developed across various scientific fields. Scalar Oscillations is the third video in this series. It was done in collaboration with Seth Ayyas (audio) and at the invitation of Arts at CERN and FACT Liverpool. I take on Rovelli‚Äôs position that: ‚Ä¶the growth of entropy is nothing other than the ubiquitous and familiar natural increase of disorder. He suggests that the fact that entropy never decreases is an appearance within particular subsystems of the universe, ‚Ä¶causality, memory, traces, the history of the happening of the world itself can only be an effect of perspective: like the turning of the heavens; an effect of our peculiar point of view in the world. Extrapolating from Rovelli, Scallar Oscillations makes a distinction between time as it functions in science and temporality; the quotidian experience of time‚Äôs apparent flow from past to future. The work proposes that the discrepancy is a result of our physiology rather than something inherent to time itself. It asks how much of our experience of temporality correlates with material conditions outside of such an experience. If we evolved only to survive reality rather than understand it, then to comprehend time we need to become something else, something beyond the bounds of the human as we currently define it. Would a collaboration with a nonembodied intelligence (mainly AI) provide a fitting partner to better understand time outside of our own physiologically influenced perspective? Reality is perhaps stranger than we have the capacity to imagine on our own. Diann Bauer is an artist and writer based in London.

With what was originally a humble flowchart, underpinned by the concept of information management, Berners-Lee‚Äôs vision unexpectedly evolved into an explosion of data, paving the foundation of today‚Äôs connected world and making it easier for people around the globe to more openly and freely share information and ideas. This proliferation of data is not a new trend, but one that continues to challenge enterprises in a positive way. Thanks to Sir Tim‚Äôs creation, the data created by Internet users now presents a multitude of opportunities for brands to secure greater insights into their customers‚Äô behaviour and preferences. However, businesses will only be in a position to use this data if they ensure they have the resources to discover, index, protect and comprehensively manage it. From the Internet to the IoT The amount of data we create every day is truly mind-boggling. Last year, Forbes forecasted 2.5 quintillion bytes of data would be created each day if we continued at our current pace, and that is in large part due to the real-life application of the IoT over the last five years or so. While estimates on the numbers of smart, connected devices may vary, it‚Äôs universally recognised that each year we can expect tens of millions of new connected devices accessing the Internet on a daily (and often more frequent basis). During the 90s and early 2000s the Internet forced organisations all over the globe to change the ways they operated and approached business decisions, so too is the IoT today. Now, for maybe first time, businesses don‚Äôt just have information at their disposal, rather, they have near real-time insight, to engage their customers and battle their competitors in ways they never previously could. For example, Australian manufacturers are using the IoT to provide real-time information by tracking materials, equipment and products through every step of the supply chain journey. Aussie businesses including North Queensland agronomic solutions provider, Farmacist, and agtech start-up, Ceres Tag, are deploying IoT sensors to track the location, well-being and activity of their livestock. Calf alert devices and tracking sensors are one of many ways Australian farmers are more effectively keeping tabs on herds that sprawl across vast expanses of ranch and farmland. It is already estimated that manufacturers alone will spend almost 42 billion USD on the IoT by 2020, and this is just one sector, however, as the number of endpoints to source, creating and using data increases, so too does the interdependence and importance of managing this data effectively and safely. Upholding the vision Back in Sir Tim‚Äôs days at CERN, the concept of ‚Äòbig data,‚Äô as we regard it today and its associated challenges, simply did not exist. His ‚ÄòInformation Management‚Äô brainchild, and blueprint for more technological development opportunities than he could ever have imagined, has changed industry and the world as we know it forever. The passing of the torch is in motion, and it is up to IT and business decision makers to harness its potential and spark change in industry, while we adapt our behaviours and practices around the technology we rely so heavily on to keep our information safe. Thankfully, Sir Tim provided IT professionals around the globe with the sturdy foundations necessary to build some of the most impactful and innovative technologies we‚Äôre likely to bear witness to in the digital age ‚Äî most recently, the IoT and its myriad of practical uses. As we stand on the brink of what could be argues is the next great wave of industrialisation with the IoT, it is unquestionably our responsibility as custodians of this new data driven paradigm (not to mention Sir Tim‚Äôs original ground-breaking discovery), to ensure that his vision of information management is continued in the purest, most effective and safest way possible. -- -- Imagine the future of data Communicator, sportsman, history-lover, enthusiastic world citizen, political onlooker & aspiring BBC WS presenter, not always in that order ‚Äî TMO.

Imagine that a developer changes the structure of the website and now you have one div in that already big expression. And your scraper does not work at all. It is not what you expect. Instead of this use selectors based on the id / name / property / class attributes. If you need to crawl a lot, consider using ready proxy management solutions, there are lots of them available on the internet. Just choose what fits best for you. From my experience, if you want to build something from scratch ‚Äî it is not worth your time and effort. Of course, this is not for one-time scrapping project.

According to Fornier, the spotlight has been placed on climate change and quality of life however communities have not been educated on the risks of a volcanic eruption. The Volcano Active Foundation aims to provide knowledge about the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Some communities might believe that a volcano will never erupt again, but through research and data Anne has been able to identify volcanoes that have erupted after 400 years. Thus there is a need to educate the communities at risk of a volcanic eruption. When asked about JET8 Technology, Anne said there is a need for a social system, as most network platforms are used as a capitalist system. If used effectively JET8 technology as the potential to make a social impact. An interview not to be missed.

Patents within this space have been embroiled in disputes and litigation throughout the decade, with the University of California and Harvard/MIT‚Äôs Broad Institute battling it out to determine who gets to cash in on CRISPR. This is because the technology has potential for curing or preventing genetic diseases and indeed could be one of the most important developments within medicine and biotech not just in the last decade, but the last century. Find out more about patenting within life sciences in our series of Academy courses on the subject üëâ See ‚ÄòIntellectual Property in Life Sciences‚Äô courses Uber is one of many tech companies to disrupt traditional industries and to really take off in the last decade, along with the likes of Airbnb, Netflix and Monzo Bank. The above patent is Uber‚Äôs first published WIPO patent and covers the principle of a user requesting transportation from a mobile device to a geographic location and selecting a driver. When this patent was first applied for in 2009, the Uber app had just gone live in San Francisco. When the patent was published in May 2011, the company had just raised $10m series A and expanded to New York. Now, in 2019, Uber is valued at $82 billion. If you think your idea could be the next unicorn, understand how to integrate IP into your strategy at an early stage with our Academy course, ‚ÄòHow to turn an idea into a start-up‚Äô üëâ Take the course Back in 2012, Google was still tying to make us believe the future was Google Glass, but then people realized it wasn't a great look and the invention was reduced to the tech graveyard, at least for now in the consumer world. Google, however, was still experimenting with ways to try and commercialise its idea. For example, the above patent describes a solution that can tell when a person is looking at an advert and would allow Google to charge in a ‚Äúpay-per-gaze‚Äù business model, similar to the ‚Äúcost-per-click‚Äù so familiar in today‚Äôs marketing. Although 5G as a technology has only just hit the consumer market in the last year, intellectual property was being filed back in 2013. The above patent is a part of the patent family for one of Nokia‚Äôs many standard essential patents in the 5G space. Nokia has played a leading role in contributing technologies to 5G and standardization. Find out more about standard essential patents within emerging technologies and 5G in our Academy course üëâ Take the course AI remains a tech buzz word for 2019 and the above patent from Google covers something called dropout, which is often used in neural network design. It is a method used to reduce ‚Äòoverfitting‚Äô ‚Äî this is where an algorithm learns training data too well and becomes too sensitive to be reliable ‚Äî and has long been popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers. It is considered to be public domain knowledge [6]. So, although it is not a patent for AI itself, it could be considered as one of the patents covering a common technique in modern artificial intelligence algorithms. While Google may never wish to enforce the patent and is unlikely to hunt down every data scientist who uses the method, the fact that it could assert rights over it will still be troubling for companies. [7] IP within the software space can be a confusing minefield so check out our course that looks at how intellectual property plays a role within open course software üëâ Take the course It‚Äôs the patent for the Marty McFly Back to the Future II shoes! This patent from Nike looks at using a motorized tightening device with a power source located within a removable insole to create a self tying shoe. Nike released this $350 shoe to the market in 2019. Called ‚ÄòAdapt Huarache,‚Äô these use Nike‚Äôs FitAdapt self-lacing technology. Earlier this year Nike also released the ‚ÄòAdapt BB‚Äô as a performance basketball shoe which connects to your smartphone. Will this tech take off or remain more of a novelty? It seems that Nike might be taking a gamble that it‚Äôs the future. See our course from Academy guest speaker Rosie Burbidge, Intellectual Property partner at Gunnercooke LLP and expert in European fashion law which covers ‚ÄòHow design rights work‚Äô üëâ Take the course In 2016, Apple published a patent that looks at tracking a user‚Äôs hand gestures to control interfaces just like in Tom Cruise‚Äôs 2002 film Minority Report. Although the idea and technology for gesture tracking has been around for a while within gaming ‚Äî with the likes of Xbox Connect from 2010 and the rather crude Sony Playstation EyeToy from 2003 ‚Äî the technology never developed beyond gaming gimmicks. It‚Äôs interesting to see Apple pushing this technology in a more serious way. Microsoft also released a similar patent in 2016 and these patents clearly show us that both tech giants are investing a lot of time and money into developing highly sophisticated next-gen natural user interfaces [8] Amazon has released some rather interesting patents over the last decade, most of which probably wont see the light of day, including a Flying Distribution Center, underground delivery tubes and voice-controlled pocket drones. The above patent definitely fits into the category of quirky Amazon patents. It describes a robotic arm that tosses warehouse items. Although Amazon currently don‚Äôt have any tossing robotic arms in their fulfillment centers and don‚Äôt look to have any plans to implement the idea at the moment, it seems that they‚Äôre not averse to protecting everything and anything, just in case. While most major car manufacturers are focusing on electric and autonomous vehicles, Ford is looking to get into the drone market with the above patent for a drone deployed from a vehicle. The drone would be deployed from a host vehicle ‚Äî most likely an emergency vehicle in response to receiving an alert signal. The drone would follow the vehicle, either autonomously or under pilot control, to illuminate accident scenes with lights and sirens, stream live photos and video of the area, boost emergency communication, and help with navigation. [11] This year, as a part of Facebook‚Äôs initiative to bring internet to all parts of developing countries, the above patent was published, which looks at using a series of kites, a ‚Äúdual-kite aerial vehicle‚Äù, in which the kites are tethered together and float at different altitudes to provide internet signal over large areas. This invention looks to improve on the more aeroplane or helicopter-like designs Facebook has already developed as part of its well-publicized Aquila project.

Papers with Code is an open platform that aggregates ML papers, code, and evaluation tables and metrics from sources such as arXiv and GitHub. The team behind Sotabench has already implemented a few benchmarks on the site and is encouraging anyone and everyone to contribute additional benchmarks and connect their repositories. Contributors will have access to free GPUs to run their code on public benchmarks, and the results can be compared to the paper results for reproducibility. So far there are eight benchmarks on the Sotabench website: Each benchmark page includes a Leaderboard summarizing and ranking existing models; a list of models on Papers with Code that have not yet been tested; and instructions on how to contribute models. For example, the ImageNet benchmark page shows a graph with a ratio of top-1 accuracy and images per second for all models tested and a list of model details including repository, top-5 accuracy, speed, paper and most importantly, whether the results reach the reported accuracy. The leaderboard will be a convenient place for practitioners and researchers to compare the tradeoff between speed and accuracy of the many models out there. Sotabench‚Äôs automatization and standardization of dataset acquisition, pre-processing and evaluation will help newcomers get started in ML and enable reviewers to easily compare models in terms of different metrics. There are of course always doubters. Because Sotabench is a free and open platform where anyone can contribute, some Reddit users are already questioning its credibility and pointing to the potential risk of data cheating. One suggested establishing a report and review system to prevent this from happening. It would however be unwise to cheat on such a public platform as the deceit would be easy to spot. The majority of reactions to Sotabench on Reddit and elsewhere have been positive, with many expressing their willingness to contribute to the centralized benchmark project. Papers with Code is a free resource website supported by Atlas ML, a startup founded by researchers and engineers from the University of Cambridge. The new Sotabench website is here.

https://medium.com/@ishannadkarni/mahindra-the-prerna-walkathon-746e7a4f8ad5?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,5000+ Mahindra and Swaraj employees walk 8 Lakh km together in just 50 days to raise Rs. 1.4 Crores for Mahila Kisan (woman farmers),Written by Ishan,Ishan,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ishan Follow -- Listen Share Mahindra and Swaraj employees and their friends and families together took 10000 Lakh Steps in 50 days to raise Rs. 1.4 Crores for women farmers through a unique initiative called ‚ÄòThe Prerna Walkathon‚Äô. What comes to your mind when you think of an Indian farmer? I am sure your imagination will be somewhat similar to this picture below. However, this is just 1/4th of the story. Did you know, that only 1 in every 4 Indian farmers are men? The rest 75% are women! A whopping 100 million women work in India‚Äôs agriculture. If you think you were alone to think this way about ‚Äòthe Indian farmer‚Äô, don‚Äôt worry. Almost everyone thinks the same way! (Watch the 2-min video to know) The frightening fact is that this 75% is the most deprived, under-represented, yet most pivotal part in India‚Äôs agriculture. They toil the most and expect the least. They have to do as much work on the fields as men, at times even more. With it, they are also expected to make the meals, clean the homes, take care of the elderly, children and cattle. And the best part is that they do all of it with a smile on their face. India‚Äôs women farmers are indeed the invisible force behind our nation‚Äôs agricultural prowess. They are the silent, unknown, most valuable contributor to our lives. It is time we recognize the woman farmer as a dominant force in Indian agriculture. ‚ÄòProject Prerna‚Äô by Mahindra & Mahindra is an ambitious program specially created to honor the superwomen who work super hard for our food. Prerna‚Äôs primary purpose is to empower the woman farmer by conducting a series of transformational experiences in her life like self-help groups and entrepreneurship groups, tractor-trainings, teaching technology insights about soil strategy, crop rotation, fertilizers, pesticides, and their optimal use. Its secondary aim is to sensitize the world at large about the lifestyle of India‚Äôs women farmers, the scale of their efforts, and the hardships they face with the hope of restoring respect and pride in the minds of our fellow countrymen and women towards their AnnaDaata (m: food giver). ‚ÄòThe Prerna Walkathon‚Äô was a 52-day long walkathon with Impact App, from October 15th, 2019 i.e. Mahila Kisan Diwas to December 5th, 2019 i.e. World Soil Day, where every step Mahindra employees and their families took raised money for the empowerment of women farmers and welfare of their families funded by Mahindra‚Äôs CSR! #DeshKiShan #MahilaKisan #MahindraMarchesForMahilaKisan And, we over-achieved! 5000+ Mahindra and Swaraj employees; and including friends and family, a whopping 10000+ people; together raised ‚Çπ 1.4 Crore for women farmers in just 50 days (2 days early) by contributing more than 10000 Lakh steps for ‚ÄòPrerna For Women‚Äô. Their steps matched by Mahindra & Mahindra‚Äôs generosity (CSR funds), made The Prerna Walkathon, the Largest People‚Äôs Movement at Mahindra! Not only was there mass awareness created among all stakeholders including employees, dealers, and their families, but they also got to contribute through action ‚Äî making Mahatma Gandhiji‚Äôs quote, ‚ÄòBe the change you wish to see‚Äô, a living reality. All in all, a massive 8 Lakh kilometers were covered for the cause across the country in less than 50 days. It‚Äôs fitting to say that, Mahindra took a Round Trip to the Moon for India‚Äôs Women Farmers. An out of this world performance indeed! What is Project ‚ÄòPrerna for Women‚Äô? Prerna ‚Äî A Mahindra initiative is aimed to support and empower Indian women in agriculture. There is a hidden need that Mahindra has realized; the need to acknowledge their contribution, and provide them with the necessary opportunities, training, and equipment to help them become better farmers and improve their lives ‚Äî Prerna is the result of this thinking and aspiration. At Mahindra, ‚Äòdoing good‚Äô goes beyond philanthropy and CSR. It is more than just random acts of kindness. ‚ÄòDoing good‚Äô is a purpose, an attitude, and a way of life. Mahindra‚Äôs four-point action-strategy is aimed at transforming the lives of women farmers by delivering them prosperity, enabling them to Rise. Why is Prerna for Women important for the women farmer? Any worker or a working professional in today‚Äôs world seeks for these three things from his or her job ‚Äî good pay, community respect and a feeling of having created Impact. These three things ensure stability, self-respect and a sense of accomplishment in their lives. I‚Äôm sure we all look for the same in our own jobs. So do our women farmers. For her; an equal wage that pays for her family‚Äôs food and her children‚Äôs education, appreciation by her local community, and knowing the fact that her mightly efforts mean many meals for millions; is sufficient. Prerna for Women directly addresses all these three things by pushing for equal-pay-opportunities, creating additional work-opportunities, holding tractor training sessions, managing self-help groups, and creating awareness in urban as well as rural India about her work and her wishes. What is Mahindra & Mahindra FES currently doing for women under the Prerna initiative to uplift the lives of women farmers? Mahindra FES is currently working on 3 major interventions under the Project Prerna Where did these activities take place? What are its outcomes so far? The first phase of Prerna was executed over the last 18 months, in over 40 villages in Odisha positively impacting the lives of over 2,000 women farmers, with the introduction of 14 farm implements, reducing drudgery in farming operations. Here are its outcomes! ‚ÄúEarlier it took 2 months to carry out weeding in our ginger plot of 1-acre land, however, this year after using a Power Weeder it took me hardly 3 hours in a seven days gap‚Äù ‚Äî Chanchala Malik, Orissa What are the next steps for Prerna? In phase two, Prerna has further forayed into 60 villages across the key states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka with the aim of empowering & reaching out to over 6,000 women farmers. And this is just the start. To quote wisdom from an age-old African, ‚ÄúIf you educate a man, you educate an individual. If you empower a woman, you empower a nation.‚Äù It‚Äôs time to Rise and empower India, one woman farmer at a time! Let‚Äôs do it. -- -- Here to write my heart out, and share the sentences that the silent soul whispers into my ears.

https://medium.com/predict/if-data-is-the-new-capital-will-there-be-data-communism-b3280bbfdc6b?source=tag_archive---------63-----------------------,"If Data Is the New Capital, Will There Be Data Communism?",And can breaking up Big Tech be the beginning of a new data ideology?,Roman Luzgin,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Roman Luzgin Follow -- Listen Share ‚ÄúData is now the form of capital‚Ä¶‚Äú‚Äî MIT Technology Review, 2016 The notion of data being the new capital (and not even the new oil) is now being pushed by the media more often than ever. This idea has gone a long way since the original MIT Technology Review article was published in 2016, and now there are not so many people left who would argue the statement has no place in reality. Data has become central and essential for increasingly more sectors of contemporary capitalism. Industries focused on technology, infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, insurance, and energy are now treating data as a form of capital. ‚Äî Jathan Sadowski Well, if data is indeed the new capital, the question arises: Aren‚Äôt we destined to repeat the circle of history here? And will data-related ideologies develop in a similar way to the capital-related philosophies? And if so, will there be‚Ä¶data communism? While the idea might sound ridiculous at first, a brief dive into the history of communism ideology and the modern development in the common perception of data being a global capital-like resource might change your sentiment. Communism, as an economic-political philosophy, is commonly agreed to be founded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the second half of the 19th century with the publishing of Communist Manifesto. The central idea of the movement was the call for a classless society with no private property, as everything should be shared ‚Äúaccording to one‚Äôs abilities and one‚Äôs needs.‚Äù In other words, give what you can, and receive what you need. Clearly, there are many details to it, but the central notion that is crucial for our analysis here is the necessary abolishment of private property and the ideology‚Äôs negative position toward capitalistic system (read, toward prominent corporations or individuals that exploit usual people, working class, for their own benefit). Most importantly, the followers of the ideology acted strongly against private capital. This is because capitalism, and private property in particular, leads to the situations where the upper class, meaning rich people with private capital, can exploit usual workers and generate extensive returns from products of labor. According to the philosophy, capital should always be a community-driven and community-owned element, as this would lead to equality, prosperity, and general happiness. In a communist society, all private ownership would be abolished, and the means of production would belong to the entire community. They desired to end capitalism feeling that it was the social class system that led to the exploitation of workers. The workers that were exploited would develop class consciousness. ‚Äî Stanford.edu Well, first of all, I assume most of the readers here can agree that data is indeed the new capital, and it is being generated, to a certain extent, by our own labor. Be it any personal data provided by us willingly to a website or all the cookies created automatically as a byproduct of our very activity in the internet. In turn, this data is accumulated by the big corporations who act as capital holders in a capitalistic system. This new capital is used by ‚Äúthe Big Tech‚Äù for various needs ‚Äî it is being invested, loaned out, or sold to other parties, thus generating returns for the capital holders and increasing their political power, just like capital in a usual sense. While data is not the same as profit, they share a similar logic. Just as we expect corporations to be profit-driven, we should now expect organisations to be data-driven; that is, the drive to accumulate data now propels new ways of doing business and governance. ‚Äî Jathan Sadowski In the modern system, we can easily detect such crucial ideology-defined points as data exploitation or extensive returns for the companies possessing the most data. For instance, how about Facebook, who‚Äôs core business activity is showing ads to a user based on the data the social media gathered from them? The company has generated $55.8 billion in revenue in 2018 with direct costs amounting to mere 17% of that value. It seems clear that the main investment that allows the corporation to prosper in this case is the data itself. Data exploitation? The scandal around Cambridge Analytica is a clear example of data misuse and user exploitation. Here, data was gathered without a user‚Äôs consent and used to influence political forces in several countries around the globe, similar to how capital had been used to achieve similar effects in the era of low data consumption. Therefore, the more data one has ‚Äî the higher is the level of power one can achieve for their own benefit. It is also seen how data is accumulated primarily by the limited number of big corporations, which creates a circle that is difficult to break. Amazon has enormous amounts of information on its users thanks to the wide reach of its business. Amazon Web Services, Amazon eCommerce platform, Prime streaming services ‚Äî all these services collect everything they can from everyone who uses them. This includes their purchasing habits, music tastes, activity hours, type of devices, purchasing power, etc. Having all this information allows Amazon to tweak and improve its services for each user, making it more appealing for us to use it more and more. And again, even more data is generated as a result of our activity. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pervasive feeling that the corporations are too powerful‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äî Vox.com, 2019 As a result, what we have is the situation where data is used directly as capital and it is being accumulated by kind of upper class ‚Äî in this case, a limited number of big corporations. We see signs of user exploitation, political issues, excessive returns for data holders. The entry barriers for smaller players without significant amounts of initial capital (initial data samples) are increasing and there appears data inequality‚Ä¶all this sounds strangely familiar to certain historic circumstances. And then too often these days we see the news and articles that call for breaking up the Big Tech for exactly the same reason ‚Äî they possess too much power, thanks to the data. They are starting to exploit users, governments, and other companies for their own benefit. Technology companies based in Seattle or Silicon Valley now account for five out of the five most valuable companies in America, leading to a spate of commentary last year from lawyers like Columbia‚Äôs Tim Wu to economists like Harvard‚Äôs Kenneth Rogoff arguing that Big Tech has, in some sense, gotten ‚Äútoo big.‚Äù And in 2019, politicians are starting to listen. ‚Äî Vox.com, 2019 www.vox.com The first steps toward stricter data regulation are already being made, especially in the European Union. Look at this piece from the recent article by the Wall Street Journal about the probe faced by Amazon in the EU: In particular, the probe will investigate whether Amazon is using nonpublic data from independent merchants to compete against them. ‚Äî the WSJ, 2019 It is increasingly more often that certain regulations are being proposed, which is definitely a good thing and all of us will likely benefit from it. But what if this is just the beginning of a new data movement, data philosophy, or data ideology ‚Äî like data communism of sorts? Imagine all the data, especially personal data generated by users, would be forcibly collected by one community ‚Äî the state or an NPO ‚Äî in order to ensure the fairness in the world. This community would claim that there should be no privately owned data, it should belong to no one and everyone. The data would then be allocated and given to the corporations according to their needs. In other words, ‚Äúgive what you can, and receive what you need,‚Äù just like Marx and Engels would argue. The reasoning would be pretty simple ‚Äî there should be no place for data exploitation by the ‚Äúupper class‚Äù, and we should build data-classless society where every actor is equal and every company has the same chances to succeed in its business, no matter if it is a trillion-dollar Amazon or a small startup. Every company would receive the amount of data it needs. And a call for equal access to data is actually something I‚Äôve heard pretty often from various AI and tech experts. By centralizing the data capital, the state would also ensure there is no data misuse. Since the original idea of communism implies some sort of authoritarianism, or strong concentration of power and relatively low freedom, the control over data would be much stricter, thus leading to no data exploitation and misuse by the Big Tech. No Cambridge Analytica-like scandals would be allowed. An example of an even more realistic development here would be a possibility of smaller corporations, or even governments, creating alliances for sharing data among each other on the same principle: ‚Äúaccording to one‚Äôs abilities and one‚Äôs needs.‚Äù Everyone would gather what they can, and receive what they require in order to build their products and services. For instance, smaller eCommerce corporations could join forces, creating a Union of Data-Driven Corporations, to collect data and share among each other in order to battle a capitalistic giant Amazon, dethroning it from its current position. Sounds relatively plausible, doesn‚Äôt it? The collection and circulation of data is now a central element of increasingly more sectors of contemporary capitalism. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. ‚Äî Jathan Sadowski Most of the ideas regarding the current state of data consumption are clearly not new and are know by the general public nowadays. But although the idea of data communism sounds rather ridiculous, it is hard to deny the situation is not impossible, especially on local levels. Clearly, all this creates avenues for the state to create a really oppressed society by exercising total surveillance, as all the data would be concentrated in one source. Moreover, high concentration of data would likely lead to corruption in the central authority, meaning it could decide to give more data to certain corporations that are more willing to cooperate with the state than others. But in the end, wasn‚Äôt this exactly what happened to communism in the USSR? So overall, combining all the current dynamics together creates an interesting picture on how we view the data today and how this might change in the future. And next time, when you hear an opinion that we should break up the Big Tech due to their data-driven power, or fix Facebook‚Äôs way of handling personal information, think about how humanity tends to lean toward extremes. Extremes such as data communism. -- -- Writing about technology, coding, SwiftUI, and stuff in-between. Creator of https://www.wellworkapp.com.

This blog post does not represent the opinion of any other individual or organization that is mentioned by the author. I do not have any business or commercial relationship with organizations mentioned in this article, however CIM Tours paid The New York Supply Chain Meetup a stipend for my services as a tour guide during NRF‚Äôs Big Show 2019. Background During the fall of 2018, my co-founder, Lisa Morales-Hellebo and I met Daniel Hodges for coffee in NYC. We discussed what we were working on, and he told us about his company, Consumers in Motion Tours (CIM Tours). Paraphrasing the description from Dan‚Äôs LinkedIn profile; CIM Tours creates experiences that transform business. They guide CEOs, BODs and CMOs through technological, and consumer behavioral changes and the resulting disruption by exposing them to innovative ideas and technologies being used by startups and other cutting-edge companies. They utilize major conferences and workshops to accomplish this task. When he asked us if we‚Äôd be interested in leading the tours for the National Retail Federation‚Äôs 2019 Big Show Conference, we immediately said yes ‚Äî after all, supply chain is our thing. What is the National Retail Federation (NRF), you ask? It is a retail-industry trade organization that has existed for more than a hundred years. According to its website, the retail industry contributes $2.6 trillion to the United States‚Äô gross domestic product ‚Äî far outstripping any other industry. As an industry, retail is the largest private sector employer in the United States. The Big Show is the NRF‚Äôs annual flagship conference ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest retail conference and expo. This year it attracted 38,000 attendees, 16,000 retailers, and 800 exhibitors, representing 99 countries. CIM helps delegates and attendees at conferences like NRF‚Äôs Big Show, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Cannes Lions, C2 Montreal, and the IoT Solutions World Congress, etc., navigate and explore the technologies and trends at the forefront of change today. You can understand why Lisa and I were excited about this. Below are the notes I prepared for Lisa and I as we were getting ready to lead the tours. We led 3 tours, each 2 hours in duration, on each day from January 13 to January 15. Note: These notes are prepared directly from materials the participating companies provided us directly, or that I found on their websites. Any direct similarities between my notes and descriptions and other materials on their respective websites is deliberate. ACCUSTORE AccuStore is a store-intelligence software platform that helps retailers maintain and update store data in real-time. It helps retailers base decisions on a single-source of data to help execute store-specific initiatives. Here are two examples of how AccuStore helps retailers. Walgreens is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the United States. Walgreens implemented AccuStore to help them with marketing cost savings. With over 8,000 stores, they were throwing away money on marketing overages by sending the same generic sign kits to every store. Since each store had unique requirements, such as the number of windows or the number of fixtures, these sign kits were not only confusing for employees to install, but stores ended up throwing away up to half of what was being sent to them. By using AccuStore‚Äôs store-specific profile data, store distributions are created for each individual store. So, each store receives only the signs that are appropriate for that location. Plus, marketing can now tailor POP by store to eliminate waste. Walgreens has saved over half a million dollars this year alone! Another example of how retailers are using AccuStore is with the company, Crocs. Crocs is a footwear brand. Crocs has saved tens of thousands of dollars during a single campaign because of accurate sign types and quantities. They needed to right-size their inventory so AccuStore developed a plan to gather and maintain their store profile data so they could send stores exactly what each store needed. Now, the information is available 24/7 via AccuStore‚Äôs cloud-based mobile platform. Plus, AccuStore helps Crocs gather store-specific information for inventory planning and store walks. RELEX SOLUTIONS RELEX Solutions helps retail businesses improve their competitiveness through localized assortments, profitable use of retail space, accurate forecasting and replenishment, and optimized workforce planning. Here are two examples of how RELEX Solutions helps their customers. Musti Group is the leading pet supplies and accessories retailer in the Nordics, with 264 stores in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. They needed supply chain integration between the company‚Äôs 5 distribution centers and 264 stores as managing changes and disruption in their supply chain was becoming a significant headache. With an implementation period of a few months in 2015, RELEX Solutions; Saarionen is a leading Finnish convenience foods manufacturer, with operations in Estonia as well. They needed demand planning software that is comprehensive, flexible, and transparent. They also wanted to introduce automation, so that planners could focus on exception management. With an implementation period of 4 months in 2016, RELEX Solutions; Other Notes: Relex Solutions just raised a $200M growth equity round from Technology Crossover Ventures. BOARD INTERNATIONAL BOARD is a software platform for unified business intelligence, performance management, and predictive analytics. Here is one example of how BOARD International helps its customers. Coca-Cola European Partners is the world‚Äôs largest independent Coca-Cola bottler. It is the market leader in one of the biggest fast-moving consumer goods markets, worth over 100 billion euros. The business serves over 300 million consumers in 13 European countries. Coca-Cola European Partners needed a supply chain finance solution to deploy across 48 manufacturing plants, 85 warehousing locations, cold drinks operations sites, and across its supply chain logistics organization. The company also needed the solution to be used by divisional CFO, heads of supply chain management, controllers, and department and plant managers. The company wanted to achieve: leaner financial operations, automated planning, and optimized reporting ‚Äî underpinning a new way of doing planning based on comprehensive communication across the company. Using BOARD, Coca-Cola European Partners has: Other Notes: I had the most fun with their team. We kept cracking jokes with one another, and it always seemed like we were old friends meeting after a long time apart. They also had an espresso station on the second day. ANAPLAN Anaplan is a software platform for enterprise-wide planning needs. The software enables financial planning, budgeting and analysis, demand and supply chain planning, sales compensation and territory management by connecting data, people, and plans. Here is one example of how Anaplan helps its customers. Sonos is a consumer electronics company with a complex supply chain enabling sales in 60 countries, and relying on more than 200 suppliers. Before Anaplan, Sonos was managing its sales, component sourcing, and supply chain through countless spreadsheets. As you can imagine, planning and forecasting was slow and prone to mistakes. Sonos is now using the Anaplan platform to build end-to-end supply chain visibility and connect plans across resources, spend, and product lines. The Sonos team started their implementation with supply and demand balancing. Then, they added a supply planning module, which enables a granular view of products at the factory level. Lastly, they incorporated demand planning to add forecasting into the mix. Anaplan has helped Sonos: Other Notes: Imagine what a surprise it was to see Vivek Soneja, a member of The New York Supply Chain Meetup at the Anaplan booth! We have grown so quickly that it‚Äôs hard to get to know everyone ‚Äî especially since I am usually running around trying to make sure that our events go on without a major hitch . . . So it was cool to see one of our members in action outside the context of one of our meetups. Lisa and I must have beamed with pride when he turned around and told everyone within earshot about how great The New York Supply Chain‚Äôs events are. In his words; ‚ÄúYou have to check it out. They are doing an amazing job.‚Äù MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES Manhattan Associates designs and builds supply chain software that connects front-end customer facing solutions with back-end operations and execution. Here is one example of how Manhattan Associates helps its customers. Adidas Group is the second largest sportswear manufacturer in the world. Adidas sought to improve its supply chain systems across all its brands, with a global implementation. Manhattan Associates‚Äô Distribution Management software has been implemented at 3 strategic sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. This has led to: Other Notes: They refused to let me have a cup of coffee during the first tour, on the first day. I‚Äôll leave it at that. I had just spent a few minutes talking up their company to the delegates on the tour, and they wouldn‚Äôt even let me have a fucking cup of coffee!? DSI DSI delivers mobile supply chain technology solutions focused on helping companies advance their business to meet the accelerated demands of the digital economy. Here is one example of how DSI helps its customers. Rally House is a national sports apparel and gift store. It specializes in immersing its customers in hometown pride by stocking products unique to each local areas professional and college teams. To do this, the company needs an efficient inventory management system, moving away from centralized planning and distribution and more towards in-store fulfillment. This became more of an issue as the company expanded to 61 stores, in 9 states, with products for hundreds of different teams, represented by thousands of SKUs. Rally House was already using DSI‚Äôs warehouse inventory management software, and so by implementing in-store logistics, the company transformed its stores from showrooms into warehouses. DSI enabled Rally House to eliminate their central distribution center within a few months and move all shipments direct to store from their vendors using their existing apps. This change eliminated weeks of costly lag time associated with the movement of warehouse shipments and expanded available inventory to customers. Rally House‚Äôs distribution processes have been simplified significantly on every level. As demand ebbs and flows for products or for specific team merchandise, stores can stock accordingly and have inventory on the floor in days instead of weeks. Individual stores can now respond faster to time sensitive and regional events ‚Äî such as World Series Championships ‚Äî by moving product direct to their stores. Other Notes: DSI was the most mobile-focused of the companies on the tour. I‚Äôd even perhaps go as far as describing them as mobile-first and mobile-only ‚Äî obviously an exaggeration, but you get the point. ENVISTA CORP enVista is a global consulting and software solutions firm that helps its customers to optimize supply chain efficiencies to drive cost savings, and unify commerce to drive customer engagement and revenue. Here is one example of how enVista helps its customers. Saddle Creek Logistics Services is a privately held, asset-based 3rd-party logistics provider. It provides omnichannel fulfillment, warehousing, and transportation services. It operates 19 million square feet of space, across 45 locations with 3,300+ employees. Saddle Creek wanted an order management system as it grew. Because of the nature of its business it was important for such a system to work for various types of clients . . . from those who ship hundreds of orders per month, to those who ship millions of orders per month. It also had to integrate with a variety of supply chain software solutions used by Saddle Creek‚Äôs clients and suppliers. enVista provided an out-of-the-box multi-tenant order management system. Saddle Creek‚Äôs developers work closely with enVista to enhance the product for Saddle Creek as well as Saddle Creek‚Äôs clients. The enhancements include automated order processing and exception handling. Saddle Creek now has: Other Notes: During one of the tours ‚Äî I do not recall which, we were lucky enough to catch Jim Barnes, CEO of enVista at the booth. Watching him engage with the delegates on the tour reminded me why it‚Äôs so important for early stage startup founders to be able to sell and engage with customers. His intensity level and mastery of the issues the delegates were curious about was without comparison throughout the tours we gave during the event. You could tell that in affected the delegates, they paid rapt attention. For example, he went fairly deep into the philosophical underpinning of enVista‚Äôs approach to unified commerce in a way no one did during the remainder of the event. MAGSTAR Magstar provides enterprise resource planning solutions with integrated POS and CRM software for retail supply chains. The company provides Enterprise Resource Planning, Point-of-Sale, Customer Relationship Management, Warehouse Management, Business Intelligence and Analytics, and Mobile Solutions specifically designed for the SMB market. It promises the same functionality and support provided by the big vendors, without the cost. For example, they said each customer is assigned to a specific customer support employee at Magstar for the duration of that customer‚Äôs relationship with Magstar. Here is one example of how Magstar helps its customers. Fields Canada is a mid-sized retailer with 62 locations and a warehouse. The company needed to reduce inventory cycle time, and gain full control over in-store inventory. Using Magstar‚Äôs Total Warehouse, Fields was able to: WHAT DID I GET OUT OF DOING THIS? I always find it fascinating to understand how customers describe the problem that they want technology to solve. Many times technologists and entrepreneurs think they are solving one problem, when customers think about the problem from a completely different perspective. The number one cause of failure among startups is the failure to find product-market-fit, which is an indication that the startup has solved a problem that customers are unwilling to pay for. Activities like this help me gain a better understanding of how customers see their world and the role that technology can play in helping them achieve their goals. One may say that on the rare occasion when I attend a conference it is to enable me do market research. I met executives from all over the world, and got to see the various perspectives from which they were thinking about deploying technology where they live and do business.

As per Drone Industry Insights, the drone market will grow to be $43 billion by 2024, which is a CAGR of 20.8%. The US and China currently dominate the commercial drone market ‚Äî together their revenue makes up over 2/3 of the global drone market, but Asia will majorly pull ahead already by the end of 2019, where India being the fastest growing market and will develop into the 3rd largest commercial drone market in the world in 2024. With this growth rate and increasing market size, the application of drones is conceivable across an array of industries. Right from delivering food, medicines, or parcels to shipping cargoes to drone taxis to inspection jobs in real estate or inaccessible terrains, the possibilities are limitless. There has been a lot of talk about drones helping reduce the carbon footprints. Let‚Äôs explore that further for ourselves. ‚Äú[I]n most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery,‚Äù the researchers write in a paper published recently in the journal Nature Communications. ‚ÄúResults suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector,‚Äù they explain. ‚ÄúTo realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.‚Äù There has been a lot of research going on in battery technology to improve performance while ensuring that batteries are lightweight, compact, and affordable. Innovations and advances are being made in a few of battery types including Lithium-ion, Solid State, Alluminium-ion, Lithium-Sulfur, and Metal-air batteries. Most experts agree that no other chemistry is going disrupt lithium-ion for at least another decade or more. As per a BCG report on batteries for electric vehicles, here are the tradeoffs between five principal Lithium-ion battery technologies: Advancements in batteries could not only transform the transportation industry, but they could also significantly affect global energy markets. According to Sure Dividend, the top 10 drone stocks to watch in 2019 include AeroVironment, Inc.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/is-azure-profitable-3531a14f6233?source=tag_archive---------12-----------------------,Is Azure Profitable?,HackerNoon.com,Mitchel Lewis,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Home Newsletter About  Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown, Oscar‚Ä¶  Mitchel Lewis Follow HackerNoon.com -- Listen Share No one wants to buy into faltering products that are here today and gone tomorrow and the same is true of businesses with regard to their IT infrastructure. Given the productivity dependencies, a traditionally slow rate of return, and steep financial burden of IT infrastructure, CTOs and the like around the world often look to key performance indicators (KPI) including revenue, profitability, customer counts, and so forth, much like a prospective shareholder, in order to anticipate the viability of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms such as AWS and Azure prior to making long-term investments in them. For example, if a service provider is breaking close to even or operating at a loss after 8 years, this could be indicative of operational inefficiencies, architectural oversights, and looming changes which increase the likelihood of costly outages. All of which may also highlight the possibility of rate hikes down the road or that the platform in question may not be standing up to the test of time. But if revenue and profit are on point, this is indicative of long-term stability and much less risk. Comparatively, it is like being given the choice of paddle boarding on a calm summer morning or in the middle of a winter snow storm. Needless to say, you can tell a lot about a solution by measuring its profitability. This is why common frontrunners such as Amazon, Apple, and Google are not bashful about disclosing individual revenue, profit, and user counts of their products. But this is also why the competition behind them tends to get creative rather than simply reporting on the same metrics. And when considering the lengths that Microsoft goes though in order to suppress the individual merits of Azure, I am forced to question just how profitable Azure truly is. Before anything else though, it‚Äôs worth highlighting that any refresher course focused on lying with statistics would remind you that omission is by far the easiest way to lie with them. Along with shying away from helpful metrics while promenading with misleading and less valuable metrics instead, essentially leveraging data like an octopus jetting its ink, their application in unison is a formidable and proven recipe for statistical gaslighting that companies behind the frontrunner of their industry love to resort to. Put simply, some businesses choose to plea ignorant and resort to diversionary tactics rather than throwing it on the table so to speak and shining themselves in a negative light with the truth; Microsoft is no exception to this. Apple is also guilty of this as of late. As mentioned before and as the #1 cloud infrastructure provider, Amazon happily reports on the individual merits of AWS by posting revenue, profit, and user counts. Why hide being the best? As the #2 cloud infrastructure provider though, Microsoft opts to bundle Azure‚Äôs earnings into a container called Intelligent Cloud which averages Azure‚Äôs revenue, profits, and losses with legacy server software such as Windows and SQL Server, Active Directory, Hyper-V and so on, making it impossible to compare the two platforms on equal ground. Azure reports total users but not revenue or profit outside of the Intelligent cloud (crutch?). Meanwhile, LinkedIn reports revenue, profit, and total users while omitting monthly usership statistics such as monthly active users (MAU). Although it‚Äôs Microsoft policy not to report on helpful metrics such as MAU, hence why LinkedIn no longer reports it, they seem to have no problem reporting it for Azure AD, Office 365, Windows, Edge, Cortana, Bing, Skype (ooops now they don‚Äôt), XBox, Minecraft, and other services that perpetuate the narrative of having a strong foothold in their market. With the above in mind, you can see how Microsoft seems to flop their policies tactically, but you can also see a clear trend of omissions being a tell just the same while seemingly trying to mask them with arbitrary policies. Sometimes not to speak is to speak with statistics and omitting data along with creative bundling tactics which Microsoft is leveraging at present are not exceptions to this, but the billion-dollar standard. Although they claim to be changed now, they still have the same general council, Brad Smith, that they‚Äôve had since their laughable antitrust days, and we can also see Microsoft putting in extra effort into muddying the waters so to speak with run rates, obscure metrics, massive marketing overspending rather than simply presenting their data; as they have done historically. However, we can still speculate by giving Azure the benefit of the doubt and simply assume that it is solely responsible for all of the Intelligent Cloud‚Äôs revenue in FY18 Q4, which was $9,606,000,000, so that we can have a look at Azure‚Äôs average revenue per account (ARPA) on its best hypothetical day and compare it to AWS. While we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs also assume that Azure has 13 million accounts rather than their 12.8 million just to account for growth since this data is over a year old. So let‚Äôs take $9,606,000,000/13 million accounts = $738.92 average revenue per account for their latest quarter. Not bad. Good job Hypothetical Azure. AWS, on the other hand, has reported a paltry 1 million accounts subscribing to it at the moment while only generating 6.68 billion in revenue, 2.1 billion of which was profit, in FY18 Q3. So we can take $6,680,000,000/1 million accounts = $6,680 average revenue per account for their latest quarter. For the sake of comparison, we can then divide AWS‚Äôs ARPA by Azure‚Äôs ARPA ($6,680/$738.92) which shows us that AWS is monetizing its accounts 9.04x more effectively than Azure is. Also and if AWS could maintain this ARPA with Azure‚Äôs account-base (6,680*13,000,000), then it would be generating $86,840,000,000 in revenue per quarter. üò≥ AWS being 31.4% efficient (profit/revenue) while being more 9.04x more efficient than Azure when measured by its ARPA also indicates that Azure efficiency could be as low as 3.5% or $359,320,000 in Q4 which in itself would easily rationalize bundling it into a container such as the intelligent cloud comprised of more efficient products. This would also mean that Azure could be generating could be generating as little as $27.64 average profit per account compared to the $2,100 average profit per account that AWS is seeing at present which is still 76x more than Azure; when it is given a significant benefit of the doubt. These differences only become greater if Azure represented half of the intelligent cloud‚Äôs revenue at $4.8 billion though. If that were the case, then they would be making averaging $369.23 in revenue per account and netting anywhere in between $163 million on the low end to $1.5 billion in profit if they‚Äôre as efficient as Amazon this quarter. If accurate, this would also show AWS to be as much as 18x more efficient than Azure from the perspective of ARPA. But I digress. In summary, when a data-driven technology company as equipped as Microsoft turns their pockets inside out instead of posting basic KPIs such as itemized profits or MAU while reporting on metrics that no one asked for instead with regard to a service that‚Äôs been in production for 8 years now, it is usually a consequence of these KPIs being contradictory of the narrative that they‚Äôre selling, not because they are not readily available. In lieu of these metrics and even when giving Azure the benefit of the doubt and compared to AWS as done above, there appears to be more disparity between AWS and Azure than Microsoft would like us to believe after being in production for 8 years. Azure may indeed be profitable, but when considering the disparity in operational efficiency between AWS and Azure and the exhaustive effort that Microsoft makes towards suppressing its individual performance metrics, I am given no option but to ask how profitable Azure is or whether it is profitable at all. -- -- Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Atatiana Jefferson, Tamir Rice, Bettie Jones, Botham Jean Engineer, Farmer, and Hellion Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-ZoOhHhoefW4acsAWdl_6A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*76XiKOa05Yya6_CdYX8pVg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-ZoOhHhoefW4acsAWdl_6A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-ZoOhHhoefW4acsAWdl_6A.jpeg"

In the modern context this is generally seen as what the most profitable option for the taxpayer ‚Äî unproductive assets are given new life so that they can generate new revenue. Intangible assets, such as intellectual property, follow a similar pattern: the rights holder has a predetermined window of time to monetize, after which the works are free for anyone to use. As of January 1st, you can perform Robert Frost at your next poetry slam without worrying about being sued. Should new concepts be monetized? Absolutely. But given the economic and technological developments of the twenty first century, locking trade secrets away is more of a marketing ploy than a sound business plan. The dustbin of history is littered with examples of overzealous IP protection for the sake of monetization, see: Betamax, Martin Shkreli, or the entire music industry. Though some companies, like Apple or Disney, have profitably pulled off highly restrictive models by relentlessly expanding into new channels, closed ecosystems are under growing pressure. Furthermore, suing fans is of questionable value and lowers potential tax revenues, and anticompetitive behavior is certainly a great disturbance in the force. There are other examples of companies acquiring IP to not make money, but rather to kill off competitors, often to our collective detriment. Enjoy your substandard widgets and your asthma. The current IP system has spun out of control ‚Äî to the benefit of the few at the cost of the many ‚Äî and is starting to be reevaluated. Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop building walled gardens. Maybe it‚Äôs time to look for different avenues for monetization. Maybe it‚Äôs time to allow reasonable access. We‚Äôve seen such a phenomenon (begrudgingly) adopted by the banking sector, via regulatory and market pressures. Historically, financial institutions have tried to set themselves up as one-stop-shops, focusing on proprietary systems that lock customers into their ecosystem to create a captive audience for cross-selling opportunities. The problem is that more than a few financial firms are focusing on the wrong monetization strategy, which is ironic because it‚Äôs in more than a few of their names: trust. Banks should monetize trust, not monopolize access. There are a clever few who see that the path forward is not to keep people out, but rather to let people in. Sure, they still sell traditional banking services, but they also run an open platform that‚Äôs available to potential competitors. Instead of locking FinTechs out, the clever few have made them API customers. Hopefully, those startups will create new products and services without having to reinvent the wheel. The bank can make a few bucks and not look like a bunch of greedy jerks. And in a strange coincidence, those banks happen to have some of the highest profit margins in the industry. That‚Äôs weird. So, maybe it‚Äôs time for a refresher on the original purpose of the Patent and Trademark Office: disseminating ideas and promoting progress (Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.) And for the companies that inhibit progress or restrict the collective taxpayers‚Äô return? Let‚Äôs do what‚Äôs best for the taxpayers, and open up some space for innovation, by using an old legal standard in a new context.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-advertising-helps-amazon-change-the-world-73b366f104d9?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,How Advertising Helps Amazon Change the World,How Amazon Is Changing the World,David Deal,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in David Deal Follow HackerNoon.com -- 1 Listen Share Amazon is an advertising powerhouse. The company is the third-largest digital advertising platform in the United States and the fifth-largest ad spender. But as CNBC noted in a recent article, Jeff Bezos wasn‚Äôt always a believer in advertising. Ten years ago, he said, ‚ÄúAdvertising is the price you pay for having an unremarkable product or service.‚Äù Why the change of heart? Because Jeff Bezos wants to change the world. And changing the world costs money. Jeff Bezos is a market maker. As I wrote in Fast Company in 2013, market makers do more than sell products. They influence beliefs and behaviors. Jeff Bezos is changing how people live and businesses operate through voice and cloud computing. Voice First Amazon, along with Google, is ushering in a voice-first world. With astonishing speed, Amazon has unleashed products such as AI-powered smart speakers that rely on voice commands to manage our homes, search for things, purchase goods and services, and navigate our cars. In the United States, 74.2 million people will use a smart speaker in 2019, according to eMarketer, up 15 percent over 2018. The Amazon Echo smart speaker, introduced in 2014, owns anywhere from 63 percent to 70 percent of the market depending on which source you read. In addition, according to Amazon‚Äôs January 31 fourth-quarter earnings announcement, Amazon‚Äôs Alexa voice assistant continues to make inroads in the home and the automobile. Meanwhile, Amazon is extending Alexa aggressively into the workplace. Here‚Äôs how Bezos‚Äôs vision for a voice-first world is playing out: Jeff Bezos is so enamored with voice that he mentioned Alexa six times in Amazon‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings announcement. In fact, Alexa is about all he talked about in a prepared statement: Alexa was very busy during her holiday season. Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the Echo family compared to last year . . . The number of research scientists working on Alexa has more than doubled in the past year, and the results of the team‚Äôs hard work are clear. In 2018, we improved Alexa‚Äôs ability to understand requests and answer questions by more than 20% through advances in machine learning, we added billions of facts making Alexa more knowledgeable than ever, developers doubled the number of Alexa skills to over 80,000, and customers spoke to Alexa tens of billions more times in 2018 compared to 2017. We‚Äôre energized by and grateful for the response, and you can count on us to keep working hard to bring even more invention to customers. Typically in earnings announcements, CEOs don‚Äôt dive into the details of how their products are evolving. But not so with Jeff Bezos. His words demonstrate his belief in the power of voice. Bezos‚Äôs comments about making Alexa more accurate might make him sound a bit geeky, but accuracy matters. Amazon needs to make Alexa more effective at recognizing human speech to make us comfortable using the voice interface to buy things ‚Äî which is what Jeff Bezos wants us to do while we are on Amazon. Right now, for the most part, people use their smart speakers to check the weather and listen to music. Jeff Bezos‚Äôs vision for voice is all about commerce, not checking sports scores. The question is not whether, but when, Amazon will realize that vision. Cloud Computing Going hand in hand with voice computing is Bezos‚Äôs ambition for businesses and people to manage their lives on a virtual network known as the cloud. Amazon founded its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2006. Today AWS provides the backbone of Amazon‚Äôs entire voice ecosystem. When you use Alexa in your home, on the go, or at work, you use AWS. Bezos envisioned the rise of cloud computing long before voice came along, though, and the cloud powers more than Amazon‚Äôs own voice ecosystem. In his 2007 letter to shareholders, he wrote of people using their Kindle e-books to read and record margin notes ‚Äúon the server-side in the ‚Äòcloud,‚Äô where they can‚Äôt be lost.‚Äù Eight years later, in his 2015 letter to shareholders, Bezos spoke of the cloud in much more grandiose terms: Whether you are a startup founded yesterday or a business that has been around for 140 years, the cloud is providing all of us with unbelievable opportunities to reinvent our businesses, add new customer experiences, redeploy capital to fuel growth, increase security, and do all of this so much faster than before. And he was not exaggerating. By 2015, AWS was providing the backbone for businesses to adapt to the cloud. Today, AWS powers so many companies that it made $25.7 billion in 2018. For example, if you use Airbnb to book a room or Slack to send a message, you‚Äôre relying on a business that uses AWS. And Netflix famously relies on AWS to keep its 24/7 content stream going. Meanwhile, cloud computing, led by AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba, continues to change how businesses operate ‚Äî helping them provide services faster and more efficiently around the clock by freeing them from the confines of physical infrastructures. It‚Äôs the cloud that makes it possible for Lyft to provide ride-sharing services or Instagram to operate. According to Gartner, the global public cloud services market will grow by 17 percent in 2019 to total $206.2 billion. As with voice, Amazon faces plenty of competition, but Amazon commands the greatest market share. Where would cloud computing be today without Amazon Web Services? But building voice and cloud-based products and services costs money. In 2018, Amazon increased its marketing and advertising costs considerably. As noted in CNBC, Amazon reported a $13.8 billion marketing expense for 2018, up 37 percent from the prior year. Nearly 100 million viewers of Super Bowl LIII saw some of that spend in the form of a number of 30-second spots promoting Alexa. Those spots cost $5 million each. And here is why Amazon‚Äôs advertising services, bundled under Amazon Advertising, are so valuable. Amazon Advertising gives Amazon a way to recoup its costs though an increasingly lucrative revenue stream. Through Amazon Advertising, businesses on Amazon promote their products through various forms of display advertising and sponsored product displays that appear in a consumers‚Äô search results on Amazon, similar to how advertising on Google works. Amazon Advertising is the result of Amazon becoming an increasingly powerful search platform. More people begin their product searches on Amazon than they do on Google. It was only a matter of time before Amazon realized it could monetize that search traffic as Google has done. Businesses are responding. According to a recent study by Nanigans, about one in three marketers are shifting their ad spend from Facebook and Google to Amazon. Amazon Advertising generated $10 billion in 2018. Amazon‚Äôs ambitions for advertising go beyond serving up ads on Amazon itself. As the New York Times reported, Amazon also targets ads to people across the digital world by tapping into the data it has amassed about consumers‚Äô purchases made on Amazon itself. Since Amazon knows exactly what you‚Äôve searched for and purchased on the site, Amazon can advertise for other brands with pinpoint accuracy, as these examples from the New York Times article illustrate: When a chain of physical therapy centers wanted new patients, it aimed online ads at people near its offices who had bought knee braces recently on Amazon. When a financial services provider wanted to promote its retirement advisory business, it directed ads to people in their 40s and 50s who had recently ordered a personal finance book from Amazon. And when a major credit card company wanted new customers, it targeted people who used cards from other banks on the retail site. The advertisers found those people by using Amazon‚Äôs advertising services, which leverage what the company knows better than anyone: consumers‚Äô online buying habits Just the Cheese, a brand run by Specialty Cheese Company in Reeseville, Wis., makes crunchy dried cheese bars that have taken off as a low-carb snack. By using algorithms to analyze how Just the Cheese‚Äôs search ads performed on Amazon‚Äôs site, the ad agency Quartile Digital noticed that people who searched for keto snacks and cauliflower pizza crust, both low-carb diet trends, also bought a lot of cheese bars. So Quartile ran display ads across the web targeting Amazon customers who had bought those two specific product categories. Over three months, Amazon showed the ads on websites more than six million times, which resulted in almost 22,000 clicks and more than 4,000 orders. That 20 percent conversion rate ‚Äî a sale to one out of five people who clicked on the ads ‚Äî was ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù Mr. Knijnik said. ‚ÄúThat is the kind of powerful granularity for building the target audiences that just Amazon can give you.‚Äù Like other ad networks, Amazon uses cookies and other technical tools to track customers from its site onto other websites. They let the company know that a person who recently bought a diet book is now reading news on CNN and could be targeted on that site with an ad for a protein bar. Amazon does not tell the advertisers who that user is, but it does serve her ads on the brand‚Äôs behalf. And, just like that, Amazon is upending the digital ad industry while creating a mini-industry of companies such as Quartile Digital that offer services related to Amazon‚Äôs advertising products. And herein lies an undeniable reality: Amazon giveth, and Amazon taketh. With advertising, Amazon takes business away from established players like Facebook and Google while spurring the launch of new companies that capitalize on Amazon. Advertising has helped Jeff Bezos pull off a feat that is extremely hard for a publicly traded firm to do: invest for the long haul while rewarding shareholders in the short term. He also does not take Amazon‚Äôs success for granted. As he told employees recently, ‚ÄúAmazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.‚Äù Whether Jeff Bezos is correct about Amazon‚Äôs future remains to be seen. In the meantime, he has helped unleash technologies whose impact is incalculable. -- -- 1 Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Atatiana Jefferson, Tamir Rice, Bettie Jones, Botham Jean Writer and pop culture lover.

https://medium.com/@scale3c/8-essential-tools-we-use-while-running-a-business-remotely-e5fb692e1a0?source=tag_archive---------142-----------------------,8 Essential Tools we Use While Running a Business Remotely,Written by Scale3C,Scale3C,No Author URL,N/A,10 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Scale3C Follow -- Listen Share Thanks to the software available nowadays, working on and managing your business remotely is more plausible than it ever was before. To do that effectively though, you need to rely on software that works for you best and you can trust. With the number of tools available, however, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the choices. In our previous article on running a fully remote business, we mentioned that communication is the key while working remotely. If you want to overcome some of the challenges of working remotely, the tools you use in your communications are just as important. To make sure that everyone is on the same page in regards to project management and deadlines, we will be discussing some of the tools we use in our daily operations. More specifically, we will be exploring the following categories and tools: Communications Slack WhatsApp GoogleHangouts Time Tracking and Security Toggl 1Password Proposals and Finances Qwilr Xero TransferWise In any business, remote or otherwise, having the proper communication channels setup first is essential. In both cases, people often struggle with communicating and updating each other properly. Which is why you should first establish consistent guidelines so that everyone knows how to contact each other and where. It‚Äôs also important to have separate communication channels as having only one is a sure way to get overwhelmed by the number of messages and end up with a lot of spam. First, define the different communication mediums you‚Äôll need, and for what purpose. For example, it‚Äôs generally good practice to have a different channel for project management recaps, instant communication, one for dealing with clients, and so on. So, here‚Äôs our take on the matter. Almost everyone uses Slack nowadays, and for a good reason, too. In a remote environment, a direct messaging tool is a must and for that, Slack is often the best tool. It has a lot of features that can simplify office communication, such as setting up different channels, file sharing (and storing), tons of 3rd party integrations (with Google Drive, Zapier, so on), and can even be used for task management practices. To make the best use of Slack, think about any other apps that you use regularly and see if you can integrate them with Slack. From fun GIFs to file-sharing and automated bots, Slack has a lot of other uses you might not know about. When it comes to using Slack, our approach is to set up different channels, each for every our client or a project. Other channels are mostly dedicated to each new project or task we‚Äôre working on and need to be able to share instant updates. WhatsApp is another instant communication platform and like Slack, it can be used for both group chats and direct messages. It‚Äôs quick and easy to set up, as it is simply tied to your own mobile device phone number ‚Äî making it a great option for personal communication. Though WhatsApp lacks some of the vital features Slack has, it‚Äôs still a powerful messaging app on its own. Depending on your business and requirements, you can also look into WhatsApp Business for additional paid features. If you‚Äôre going to be using WhatsApp in addition to other communication channels, it‚Äôs important to have a different use for it so that you know when to use which app. For example, while working remotely, there might be times when you need to get a hold of someone in case of an emergency. In such case, WhatsApp is ideal if you want to receive a reply straight away. Since the app is tied to your phone number, chances are, whoever you‚Äôre texting will receive it immediately. Similarly, WhatsApp also offers a variety of formats when messaging, which means you won‚Äôt be limited to text alone. While direct messaging can be used for most working environments (online team meetings, dealing with clients, so on), it simply can‚Äôt replace video calls. For online meetings, conference rooms, webinars and more, Google Hangouts is ideal. It‚Äôs easy to set up a meeting and invite other members. If you‚Äôre going to be dealing with a lot of clients in your business or need to be constantly catching up with other team members, it‚Äôs a good idea to have a stable video platform set up in place. With Google Hangouts, it‚Äôs convenient to get set up with all of the above and jump into a meeting straight away. As an added benefit of it being part of GSuite, the app can integrate into your other Google products, such as Google Calendar. Because most businesses use GSuite to begin with, they automatically get Google Hangouts for free. From all of the video calling software we‚Äôve tried, Google Hangouts ended up being more reliable, and easier for clients to join. Compared to Zoom, for example, Google Hangouts is free, can hold more people for a longer period of time, and doesn‚Äôt noticeably lag behind in terms of quality either. What gets measured gets managed. To be successful, you need to be keeping track of what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and have the data to back it up. This is even more the case when you‚Äôre working remotely and use a lot of tools in your business. In that case, one of the most important metrics you should be keeping track of is your time. Toggl is a powerful time tracking software that boosts productivity and shows you where and how you spend most of your time. If you want to get a sense of how long each project or task usually takes and how (or where) your team spends the majority of their time, you can do so with Toggl. The platform works where you do, no matter the device, even has the option of manual time entries, and by the end of it, Toggl provides a report of your work productivity based on the hours. It can be as detailed or simple as you need it to be. For small businesses and freelancers, it‚Äôs ideal as it comes with a powerful reporting system and plenty of team management features. Main benefits include better internal resource planning for businesses, accurate and transparent client billing, and making work time more focused, based on the specific project. Overall, the aim of the tool is to increase team productivity. Depending on your needs and the size of the team, you can either go with the basic features or the advanced plan. If you‚Äôre going to be using a lot of different tools, it‚Äôs a good idea to have one place dedicated to managing and organising everything. While working remotely, keeping track of passwords on sticky notes in the office won‚Äôt cut it anymore. So, to ensure everyone on the team has access to all the shared software without exposing the company to the risk of cyber threats, it‚Äôs worth investing in a password management software. 1Password is a simple all-in-one password management tool that does what it says. With it, you‚Äôll only ever need to keep track of one password, which will then give you access to your other saved passwords. As with most password management tools, security is key. This is why the information you store in 1Password is encrypted and can only be accessed from a device you‚Äôve already approved. Finally, if you‚Äôre going to be working with clients on a regular basis, it‚Äôs a good idea to have a ready system for the whole onboarding process, start to finish. The order might look something like this: First, you send a proposal detailing all of your services, the cost, and other important details in a high-quality proposal, you send them an invoice for the exact amount, and finally, have a ready-to-go money transfer account. These are the tools we use for the above process. Qwilr is an online tool for creating and sending professional proposals, sales, and marketing documents. The tool has a lot of different uses, from individuals to teams and organisations, allowing you to pitch your services with confidence through a proposal document that best represents you. The vision behind Qwilr is to make the future of documents online. This means no more PDF or Word proposals. Instead, with Qwilr, you can customise your proposal so that it best represents your brand. Their website has a number of award-winning templates to help you get started, which you can customise to fit your brand. You can add your logo within the proposal, edit and add interactive elements (e.g. customisable pricing table), and represent your visual identity through other means. Finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that with Qwilr, you can also track your proposals. Meaning, you‚Äôll get a notification when they first view it, how long they view it, and when they accept it. If they don‚Äôt accept it though, you‚Äôll know to refine your proposal and follow up accordingly. If you‚Äôre going to be doing business online, it‚Äôs essential to be keeping track of your invoice and overall finances. To manage your finances and invoices in an all-in-one accounting software, we recommend using Xero. The accounting software has a lot of uses, and allows you to run your business on the go from anywhere, anytime. While finances are often an intimidating field for many startups, using Xero to manage your situation is easy to learn and has all the time-saving tools needed to grow your business. Important features include being able to keep track of your cashflows and expenses in real-time, attaching other files to your invoices, paying bills, and finally, being able to generate an end of the month report to assess your overall situation. The tool is easy to set up, has an intuitive user interface to simplify your finances and is powerful enough if you need to manage your overall financial situation on the go. Finally, you might have already heard of TransferWise, as it‚Äôs another essential tool when it comes to sending and receiving money online. One of the best things about it is the fact that it comes with its own real exchange rate (also known as the mid-market rate) and doesn‚Äôt set ridiculously high fees like most banks do. If you‚Äôre going to be sending and receiving money to different countries, you need to make sure you‚Äôre not losing any on the currency exchange fees. Most banks charge more for this. TransferWise, meanwhile, stays 8x cheaper than the average bank. In addition to the transfer rates working in your favour, the online digital bank also tracks your money and sends an email with each stage of the transfer. Most online businesses and freelancers go with TransferWise to save costs, since as of right now, it‚Äôs one of the best and the cheapest ways to send money abroad. All in all, depending on the software you use, running a business remotely can be a convenient experience for everyone involved or a nightmare of a process. To save you time and money, you need to be making sure that the tools you‚Äôre using are working for you, not against you. Which is why you need to be using the tools that work perfectly for you. There are a lot of different fields in which using certain software can help alleviate some of the challenges that come with working online. The above is only a small list of the many tools we use consistently now. Finding the right set of tools that work for you best takes time and patience. The above list is what we stuck with and so far, has been extremely productive for our team. -- -- Helping companies improve their tech and product development Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*9zyHeBjoeGzFNm3r6BNqMg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*9zyHeBjoeGzFNm3r6BNqMg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*9zyHeBjoeGzFNm3r6BNqMg.jpeg"

La tristesse provient plut√¥t du fait que ces repr√©sentations soient con√ßues non pour leur sens profond, mais pour correspondre aux crit√®res d‚Äôune plateforme ; que le contenant l‚Äôemporte sur le contenu. Que la joie intime soit cadr√©e et liss√©e √† la fa√ßon d‚Äôune campagne publicitaire. La tristesse vient du fait d‚Äôavoir laiss√© une industrie s‚Äôapproprier le bonheur humain, √† tel point que le langage m√™me en est modifi√©. Les fa√ßons d‚Äôexprimer l‚Äôamour ou la joie sont alt√©r√©es pour correspondre √† un discours global qui ne tol√®re que superficiellement la singularit√©. Malgr√© son d√©luge de belles images et de messages positifs, le monde Instagram un monde immobile et mort, parce que clos. Ferm√© sur lui-m√™me, il est aussi rassurant qu‚Äôune cabane d‚Äôenfant. A l‚Äôabri de la temp√™te et de l‚Äôhostilit√© du monde ext√©rieur, ce monde est tout entier concentr√© sur son r√™ve petit-bourgeois de domesticit√©. On y c√©l√®bre tous les attributs du foyer : l‚Äôunion amoureuse entre deux √™tres, la famille, la nourriture, la d√©coration int√©rieure. C‚Äôest le r√®gne de l‚Äôinventaire, de l‚Äô√©tiquetage et du s√©quen√ßage. La magie √©clatante d‚ÄôInstagram, c‚Äôest son pouvoir de transformation du monde en une s√©rie de vignettes o√π s‚Äôexprime la satisfaction d‚Äôavoir domin√© le r√©el. La curiosit√© devient fixation st√©rile : on se projette soi dans l‚ÄôAilleurs plus qu‚Äôon ne cherche √† le comprendre. L‚Äôimaginaire s‚Äôexprime dans sa forme la plus superficielle : la collection d‚Äôimages. Les exp√©riences humaines y d√©contextualis√©es ; ce sont des absolus qui ne signifient rien, si ce n‚Äôest que l‚Äô√™tre humain, quel que soit son environnement, partage une m√™me essence et une m√™me vibration enfantine pour des √©motions primaires, coup√©es √† la racine. Cet √™tre humain universel n‚Äôest pris dans aucune structure sociale ; il est d√©politis√©. La logique Instagram ne comprend ne l‚Äôinteraction sociale qu‚Äôen termes de points, la vie en termes d‚Äôactions mises en sc√®ne. L‚Äô√©panouissement sera productif ou ne sera pas. Kim Kardashian, la femme au 124 millions d‚Äôabonn√©s, est l‚Äôune des incarnations les plus efficaces de la mythologie Instagram. Elle est le triomphe √©clatant du bonheur bourgeois, de la cellule familiale, de la domesticit√© et de la propri√©t√©. Son corps rel√®ve de l‚Äôextraordinaire, du merveilleux. Qu‚Äôelle semble poss√©der un contr√¥le absolu sur celui-ci pr√©sente un charme puissant. Alors que le sentiment de ne plus rien ma√Ætriser dans nos existences se fait plus violent et plus d√©sesp√©r√©, ma√Ætriser son corps pr√©sente un dernier rempart contre le chaos, la fuite, l‚Äôincessant changement de nature des √©l√©ments. Parfois, des comptes market√©s jusqu‚Äô√† l‚Äôagonie imitent le naturel et nous nous r√©jouissons de cette proximit√© avec des √™tres sup√©rieurs. Jouir de l‚Äôombre des rois et des reines, c‚Äôest leur reconna√Ætre un statut surnaturel. Parmi le commun des mortels, il arrive qu‚Äôune distanciation veuille s‚Äôop√©rer et qu‚Äôune l√©gende ironique ou ambigu√´ accompagne une photo convenue. Le jeu est de d√©clarer son intention, comme de suspendre le geste et de rester fig√© dans un acte interm√©diaire, ni tout √† fait candide ni totalement artificiel. ‚ÄúNous souffrons par les r√™ves et gu√©rissons par les r√™ves‚Äù √©crit Gaston Bachelard dans son essai L‚Äôeau et les r√™ves : Essai sur l‚Äôimagination de la mati√®re.

https://medium.com/@shagunm1210/16-years-old-and-living-my-dream-1fedf49f7f4?source=tag_archive---------87-----------------------,16 Years Old and Living My Dream üöÄ,Personal Thoughts on AI,Shagun Maheshwari,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shagun Maheshwari Follow -- Listen Share Imagine you are a 16 year old who has the mission of wanting to positively impact at least a billion people in the world through technology. Now imagine you had an opportunity to intern at a company that was doing exactly that! I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd classify that person as the luckiest 16 year old in the üåé. The crazy thing is, that‚Äôs my reality right now and I do feel like the luckiest 16 year old in the world. This amazing company is called XPRIZE which is probably one of the most revolutionary companies you have ever come across. This is because XPRIZE sets hugely ambitious but audacious goals to improve the world. The mission is to create incentive competitions that target a pressing problem we see in our world today. These competitions are focused around topics such as increasing water abundance, recycling CO2 from the atmosphere into valuable products, and increasing adult literacy, etc. But the thing that really makes me the luckiest 16 year old in the world, is the fact that I get to work on the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE! This was literally a dream come true as over the past year I have developed a huge passion for artificial intelligence and the impact this technology can have in improving our world today. My deep interest in this technology led me to research into understanding the theory of complex deep learning concepts as well as self-learn how to build numerous different AI models. I found a particular interest with applying machine learning to genomics data which led me to build a model called a variational auto encoder that can identify which genes lead to cancerous tumours. The $5M IBM Watson AI XPRIZE What excites me the most about this XPRIZE is that it‚Äôs not creating an incentive competition to target just one problem, but actually numerous problems ranging over the topics of health diagnosis, health treatment, mental health, environment, education, humanizing AI, and improving the developing world. For example, ORBEM is a team a part of the AI XPRIZE that is leveraging image classification AI technology + MRI tech to differentiate between male and female chicken eggs. This is a huge problem they are tackling as previously no one could identify the gender of an egg before it was hatched. Not knowing the gender beforehand actually resulted in 7 billion baby male chicks being killed every year + billion of eggs going wasted that could have been used to feed the population. Another team called Element Inc, is using image classification to give digital identity to children in poverty. Around 1.1 billion people in the world don‚Äôt have any digital identity because of their economic situation. Element is making this scalable by enabling a smart phone camera to capture a child‚Äôs biometrics data in order to give them an identity. As you can see, both teams are using a subsection of AI called image classification, but they are leveraging that technology to solve 2 completely diverse problems. These are just 2 out of the 34 teams using the power of AI to tackle some of the world‚Äôs most known and unknown problems! One of the main reasons I‚Äôm so passionate about AI is because I see it as a tool with enormous amount of potential to leverage in solving the challenges we face in our world. The current status of AI is pretty much a tool that is being used to a) Optimize & Personalize our life b) Model complex problems and reach the output with more efficiency + accuracy I see development in AI as building new tools and filling our toolbox to help solve problems that were tedious to solve before with our bare hands. However, majority of people think of AI and instead of seeing it as a toolbox, they see it as this‚Ä¶ The reality is, we have not yet reached the stage of Artificial Super Intelligence which is AI that is 10x smarter and more powerful than us. Our current status quo is Artificial Narrow Intelligence. ANI is AI that extremely good at one particular task but cannot translate that intelligence to do another task. Examples are: Google‚Äôs AI system was able to beat the world‚Äôs best Go champion, in a match held in 2017. A computer vision algorithm was created to use pattern recognition to identify breast cancer in the slide images of a patients tissues. This AI model had an 89% accuracy in detecting breast cancer while the average accuracy of a trained pathologist was 73%. But an AI system has not yet been created that can output and perform on many diverse tasks like our human brain can. TL;DR Artificial Narrow Intelligence can be 10x more efficient/accurate that humans, when trained to do a particular task but the current status of the technology is not able to generalize and do multiple tasks like the human brain can. For these reasons, I truly believe investing in the current state of AI is extremely important for humankind. However this is not to say that ANI does not have the power to be used for malicious intent. With the huge amounts of data being aggregated about us through the technology we are using, privacy becomes a huge concern when companies like Dessa are able to create voice cloning technology that is accurate to the extent they can generate audio of your voice saying anything they want it to. Or when this technology is used in the wrong hands to create a DeepNude app that uses neural networks to remove clothing from the images of women, making them look realistically nude. AI has the potential to do harm but it also has the potential to do a lot of good. Incentive competitions such as the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE challenge and the Google AI Impact Challenge are structures to catalyze innovations with a positive impact using this AI technology. üöÄ -- -- 16 year old machine learning developer interested in philosophy, programming and gaining new experiences.

Let me show you how to reduce this to something more manageable. Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. We are using Vuex to share state between all the applications in our Factory Core Framework application. Since the framework is a bundle of applications, we currently have nine Vuex stores. Each store has its own state, actions, and mutations. We are using actions in the store to do API calls to the backend. Once the data is returned we use mutations to store it in state. This allows any component to access that data. As you can imagine, our stores can have a very large number of actions to handle these API calls. Here is an example of all the actions in one of our Vuex stores. -- -- 17 Helping web professionals up their skill and knowledge of Vue.js Software Engineer. Google Developers Expert.

From Google Cloud Study Jam, which introduced developers to platforms like Kubernatees and Docker to Google I/O Extended event, which touched on Android and Google Web technologies, also to the Women Tech Makers Event, which was an avenue for women to learn more and get involved in the tech community. There was also Flutter Study Jam which helped developers get familiar with the Flutter technology for Mobile development. The last which was DevFest Lagos where GDG Ibadan actively participated in presentations and planning. In all of these events, we had many developers learn from various facilitators within and outside the community and their contributions have made the community grow significantly well.

A rating and a review on iTunes would go a long way! Today‚Äôs question comes from Lucien. I have a prototype built for a B2C app but I‚Äôm trying to decide what my focus should be in the MVP phase. How should I think about the next stages of my business development? Every founder has this problem when they are ready to launch, especially in the B2C space. How do you think about revenue, features, and monetization models? In the MVP stage, you should launch without charging. The reason you should take this approach is because it‚Äôs critical to acquire users so you can start to figure out how they are using their app. It‚Äôs hard to determine which features to charge for if you don‚Äôt know what is valuable to your users. And everything should be driven by your customers in a startup. This isn‚Äôt a long-term thing, but you need to start getting some feedback. If you already built the features you think could be premium, then why did you build them? Odds are, if you already built features that could be premium features then you probably waited too long to launch. When your free features are done, you should launch. Sprinkle in some places where you would put the paid features to see if people are trying to access them. This will help you understand which ones are actually valuable and that people will pay for because you have actual data. To do this effectively, you have to make sure you are tracking data. Too often people just throw money at various parts of their marketing and development and they don‚Äôt track the appropriate data to ensure that they can take their next steps with confidence. The simpler you can make all of these processes in the beginning, the better. ‚ÄúAll of your decisions as a startup should be based on your customers and what they are telling you is valuable and important to them.‚Äù Got questions about startups and/or startup culture?

For many of us, we don‚Äôt have to make amendments to the way we find information and navigate websites, but for the 1billion+ people worldwide living with some form of disability, access to information isn‚Äôt always so straight forward. Accessibility awareness has risen in recent years and as a result, more and more brands operating online have made changes to their site to make the browsing experience more accessible to everyone. However, there‚Äôs still loads of room for improvements. With more than 59million distinct accessibility errors, detected by Google through research, across 1million home pages, this amounts to approximately 60 errors per page. It‚Äôs important to remember that a disability, which will affect your ability to use the internet to its full effect, does not end begin and end with vision, hearing, movement or cognitive impairments. User needs are far more complex, and it would be naive to limit the usability to only cater to these disabilities. The diversity of the user base is so extensive now that accessibility optimisation needs to understand every limitation which is currently affecting people around the world. Designing for accessibility needs to grow and evolve, which ultimately results in better user experience for everyone. One of the common issues with websites is low contrast, which for people with visual impairments, can cause an accessibility issue. Ensuring your site has sufficient colour contrast, will make viewing easier, especially for mobile users whilst on the go. You should ensure that your site layout is clear and concise. It might look nice to make menu items small in size, however, for people with visual impairments this can quickly drive them away from your site or make it completely unusable. Enhancing the appearance of your copy, by increasing the size of the font on your site, as well as ensuring that colours can be seen easily by those with visual impairments including the likes of colour blindness, is important for overall accessibility. Presuming that everyone has the same level of reading abilities is both unfair and can result in confusion. It‚Äôs important to be simplistic with language when creating the key elements of your site, including who you are and how to contact you. Plain language over specialised terminology may seem counterproductive if you work in an industry which relies heavily on this, but it‚Äôs important to simplify it to ensure that everyone can understand what it is that you do, regardless of reading level or level of understanding of the English language. Furthermore, headers and shorter paragraphs can help users determine content hierarchy on a page, for improved ease of use. This also has significant SEO benefits, by making it clear to a search engine what the key topics of the page are. Dexterity can be a barrier to utilising the web to its full potential. Particularly where data entry is concerned, it‚Äôs vital to reduce the overall effort of inputting information on the users part. Alongside the ability to import auto-fill information, sites should consider including the likes of a number pad or expanded options to choose from, where possible. The benefits of this type of streamlining capability are felt across all users, in fact, it can make people more likely to complete their purchase when their information is more easily inputted. Alongside this, as voice recognition becomes more advanced, inputting via speech will be more commonly rolled out across all websites, so ensure that your site is optimised and ready for this functionality. When considering how you will design and create your site, you should be aware of load speed. Of course, slow load speeds can affect your search capabilities but they also impair the user experience. Accessing your websites data should be at the core of your user experience process. So, it might mean that you can‚Äôt display loads of high res images or video on your home page, but you can find ways around, either through changing the design or compressing assets. With mobile more prevalent than desktop in most areas of the world, it‚Äôs important to ensure you have optimised and built your site with load speed in mind, ensuring accessibility to everyone. Ensuring your site is compatible with assistive technology, such as screen readers, hearing aids and magnification applications, allows full user capabilities to those with disabilities attempting to access your site. You should consider increasing the tappable areas of buttons to make them more easily reached and interactable and design inline with thumb reach research, considering different designs of mobile phone. Additionally, keyboard shortcut navigation should be fully implemented to ensure that those who cannot use a mouse are able to receive a good experience on your site, regardless. You can use sites such as web.dev which will run a basic accessibility audit, score your site and offer insights into best practices and recommendations for improvement. Alternatively, get in touch with us today for a free website audit where we will identify any areas of your website which could be jeopardising usability and accessibility.

Let's see where we go from here! The latest update to the Verge Currency iOS wallet, v1.2.0! You can download it today from the App Store! This release brings the following features and bugfixes: The 1.2.0 update also made the wallet iOS 13 compatible. However, it was not built using the iOS 13 SDK. This means we miss out on some nice default iOS 13 UI changes. In the next big update, we‚Äôll be focusing on supporting the full iOS 13 SDK and add the additional features that the SDK supports. We recovered all the v4 core requirements, from the old blockchain to the new blockchain. I will try to cover all the changes that were made in order to give you a good overview of our fellow miners experience. At this point, I wanted to say thank you to all the people who were really helpful in finding, identifying and also resolving bugs with lightning speed. This couldn‚Äôt have been done without: In order to archive that we sat together and solved issue by issue that had to be addressed in order to build a fluent mining process. But those changes were mostly contrary to what the bitcoin base has given us. Thus, we decided to note those places down and decide for follow up tasks that would be nice to be implemented, such as: (mostly hardfork topics) Besides those controversy topics there have also been some fixes within: Features that also have been implemented: For this update I‚Äôm going to be like our upcoming wallet, lightweight (public sadly laughing in the background). I‚Äôve been implementing the VWS Service URL change feature in the wallet settings as you can see here: Exactly like in the iOS wallet, in the Android wallet you‚Äôll be able to use our public Verge Wallet Service (VWS) but you can also set up your own node (instructions here : video). Besides, I‚Äôve pretty much wrapped up the PIN feature. I‚Äôve implemented it only in the paper key for now, but the structure has mostly been defined and I‚Äôm a couple lines away from adding it to upcoming features (like sending money). Of course, the PIN number can be reset anytime from the settings. Otherwise, I‚Äôve been working on minor UX fixes, such as renaming titles or once a setting has been changed (like the fiat currency) and getting back to the settings page instead of making that a manual action.

https://medium.com/@andrewcaldas/por-qual-motivo-est%C3%A1-surgindo-tantas-start-ups-no-brasil-b70e04f10e0a?source=tag_archive---------104-----------------------,Por qual motivo est√° surgindo tantas Start-ups no Brasil?,Written by Andrew Caldas,Andrew Caldas,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Andrew Caldas Follow -- Share Em primeira circunst√¢ncia, irei explicar o meu ponto de vista, dentro das minhas observa√ß√µes referentes a livros e jornais que tratam a respeito do assunto prescrito, e motiva√ß√µes importantes que andei notando dentro de algumas promissoras empresas brasileiras. Segundo, a Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Startups (Abstartups), o Brasil conta com mais de 10 mil startups, e a maioria delas est√£o sediadas no Sudeste, principalmente, na grande S√£o Paulo. Muitos estados brasileiros est√£o tendo um crescimento acelerado de novas empresas tecnol√≥gicas, normalmente estas empresas se localizam dentro de escrit√≥rios corporativos, nos centros das grandes cidades. Acredito que, o grande motivo da cria√ß√£o dessas novas startups, giram em torno da grande demanda de tecnologias nas novas e velhas empresas, que obviamente, querem automatizar e melhorar os seus processos. As grandes e velhas institui√ß√µes que sempre cuidavam dessa demanda, devido ao seu tamanho e reputa√ß√£o, √© normal possu√≠rem um alto pre√ßo pelos seus servi√ßos, mas as novas startups trouxeram o mesmo servi√ßo com um pre√ßo mais atraente, chamando a aten√ß√£o dessa demanda. Para os neg√≥cios, isso √© √≥timo, j√° que traz concorr√™ncia e melhores servi√ßos. Nos √∫ltimos anos, o n√∫mero de pessoas empreendendo foi significativo, o crescimento econ√¥mico do Brasil foi um dos respons√°veis pelo surgimento de novos empresas, isso j√° √© notado por investidores estrangeiro, que est√£o empolgados com esses novos empreendimentos. Antes desse acr√©scimo, geralmente o empreendedorismo acontecia quando algum individuo era demitido, e ent√£o abria o pr√≥prio neg√≥cio. Essa efervesc√™ncia toda rendeu ao Brasil uma boa posi√ß√£o no relat√≥rio Startup Ecosystem de 2012 e S√£o Paulo aparece na lista de melhores lugares para empreender no mundo. ‚ÄúUma boa reputa√ß√£o vale mais do que dinheiro.‚Äù Publilius Syrus, escritor romano de m√°ximas. De fato, isso √© algo positivo para a economia brasileira, j√° que novos neg√≥cios significam um mercado de maior concorr√™ncia e novos empregos. Al√©m disso, o Brasil fica cada vez mais √† frente em dire√ß√£o as maiores economias mundiais, mas antes de tudo, necessitamos de um maior conhecimento econ√¥mico. Mesmo que o termo parece se tratar de uma pequena empresa, criar uma Startup n√£o √© para qualquer um, os riscos de abrir uma empresa de tecnologia vinda de uma ideia nunca usada, requer uma dose de coragem e risco, √© bem diferente de criar um pequeno ponto de venda em uma rua movimentada, h√° pontos de vendas em todo canto, j√° foram aceitos, os modelos est√£o l√°, passo a passo. Ap√≥s a minha leitura do livro ‚ÄúA mente do empreendedor‚Äù de Kevin D.Johnson, fiquei animado em criar o meu pr√≥pria neg√≥cio, e n√£o se trata de ir em algo grande j√° de cara. Empreender significa em primeira caso, tentar, por exemplo, como voc√™ saber√° que sua ideia cativara clientes sem ao menos jogar na boca do povo e ver o que acontece. Caso apare√ßa ordens de compra ou interesse na sua ideia, ent√£o voc√™ est√° no caminho certo. Fa√ßa isso antes de criar um Business Plan e todo o processo de cria√ß√£o, imagine o quanto seria desanimador se ap√≥s a cria√ß√£o, o seu projeto n√£o gerasse nenhuma venda. ‚ÄúO sucesso √© consequ√™ncia de tomar a iniciativa e fazer o acompanhamento posterior. Anthony Robbins, escritor e palestrando profissional. Futuramente escreverei mais a respeito da cria√ß√£o de uma Startup, do inicio ao fim. Caso haja interesse, sigam o meu perfil no Medium.

At the end of the day, it really boils down to one thing: trust. Trust your team to do their job. Trust them to make decisions, to ask for help when they need it, or voice their opinions. Everyone wants to feel valued. Nobody wants to be micromanaged. For us, this trust manifests in a number of ways. We don‚Äôt put limits on vacation time and sick days and we trust that our employees will responsibly manage their workloads, communicate with the team, and schedule time accordingly. Trust in your team‚Äôs ability to the point that when it comes to structure, you can essentially run flat. This is a bold move, and it‚Äôs not for everyone, but we‚Äôre fortunate that it works for us. We don‚Äôt operate within an org chart of executives, managers, and supervisors. We have only leaders, and on any given project, anyone can step into a leadership role depending on their expertise or desire. This allows for huge growth opportunities for employees to explore and steer their career down the path of their choosing. As a part of my series about about how leaders can create a ‚Äúfantastic work culture‚Äù, I had the pleasure of interviewing Kevin Lee. Kevin is the Co-Founder and Creative Director of digital experience agency INPHANTRY, where he has created breakthrough campaigns and experiences for History Channel, Captain Morgan, HSBC, PUMA, and Delta. Leading a team of designers, strategists, and technologists at his Boston-based agency, Kevin is passionate about creating immersive digital experiences that resonate with people and bring relevance to brands. Thank you so much for doing this with us Kevin! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path? I‚Äôve always been a self-starter and tinkerer. When I was young, I probably spent more time learning how to make things online than I did in the classroom. My interest in design and technology led me to art school, but after landing an internship at what was one of the few digital agencies at the time, I quickly realized (yet again) that I was going to learn a lot more in the real world. So, halfway through my freshman year, I dropped out and jumped headfirst into the agency world and never looked back. The path that led me to where I am today was no less interesting. I was part of a team that was commissioned by a Europe-based online poker company to create a memorable experience for a Las Vegas event. Twitter was relatively new and touchscreen devices were nearly unheard of at the time, and we had to figure out how to build an experience that was not only engaging for players at the event, but also easily shareable with their friends and families back home in Europe. We ended up building a touchscreen, Twitter-enabled photo booth from the ground up. Keep in mind, this was before social photo booths were even a thing. That early experience is what led us to create INPHANTRY. We saw the excitement of attendees interacting with something digital in the physical space and instantly knew we were on to something. The ‚Äúhacker‚Äù mentality required to innovate on the fly came naturally to us, but we understood that there was something bigger than just technology going on. It was about helping brands connect with consumers by giving them an experience they‚Äôd never forget. Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began leading your company? I think the most interesting thing for me, personally, has been just growing up with the company we started and watching all of us evolve. In the beginning, we were a group of kids figuring it out. Whether it was creating an experience at Lollapalooza that led to us being onstage with LL Cool J, to taking a break from an activation in Vegas to go on a joyride and get lost for hours in the desert, it just felt like one big crazy adventure. Now, some of us ‚Äúkids‚Äù have kids of our own. We‚Äôve grown into specialists at what we do. We‚Äôve added new members to the team from all kinds of backgrounds ‚Äî some of whom are as young as we were when we started. But what‚Äôs interesting to me is that it still feels like we‚Äôre on the same crazy adventure. The team has gone through changes, but we‚Äôre still in it together, having fun, and the bond is as strong as it ever was. Are you working on any exciting projects now? How do you think that will help people? Yes, while we can‚Äôt reveal any specifics yet, we are currently creating experiences for major brands in sportswear, automotive, and even construction and real estate development. Each project is different in terms of strategy, execution, and reach; however, the central theme here is we are being tasked with developing experiences that fulfill our clients‚Äô needs by merging storytelling with technology. In terms of how our projects can help people, first and foremost, we have a responsibility to deliver work that addresses our clients‚Äô respective challenges, but because we focus on user experience, what we do is only successful if it ultimately benefits the audience we‚Äôre trying to reach. Whether it‚Äôs creating a touchscreen experience that enables homeowners to design and envision their dream home in real-time, or building an augmented reality app that lets you show off your personal style, we find that it‚Äôs less about advertising products and more about understanding people‚Äôs needs and helping them achieve whatever it is they want to do. Ok, let‚Äôs jump to the main part of our interview. According to this study cited in Forbes, more than half of the US workforce is unhappy. Why do you think that number is so high? I think a lot of it has to do with having a sense of purpose and being invested in what you‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs no secret that many workplaces value structure, hierarchy, and process over communication and personal interaction. While this model may work for some, the way we work today is changing. I can only speak for my industry, but when your job is literally to be creative every day, that kind of structure and bureaucracy can lead to burnout and frustration over time. When we feel free to experiment and take risks without fear of failure, however, we look forward to going to work and trying something new with our teammates. It‚Äôs the main reason why we‚Äôve remained small and why we work the way we do at INPHANTRY. Based on your experience or research, how do you think an unhappy workforce will impact a) company productivity b) company profitability c) and employee health and wellbeing? When an employee is unhappy with their current situation, they lose interest and motivation. Daily tasks become chores, and interactions with other co-workers become short, blunt, and aggressive. Their focus is inward as opposed to taking a collaborative approach, and it only takes one unhappy person to change the tone of the entire team. It‚Äôs bad for business and worse for your emotional health. Can you share 5 things that managers and executives should be doing to improve their company work culture? Can you give a personal story or example for each? I came up with five; however, each point follows a consistent theme. At the end of the day, it really boils down to one thing: trust. Trust your team to do their job. Trust them to make decisions, to ask for help when they need it, or voice their opinions. Everyone wants to feel valued. Nobody wants to be micromanaged. For us, this trust manifests in a number of ways. We don‚Äôt put limits on vacation time and sick days and we trust that our employees will responsibly manage their workloads, communicate with the team, and schedule time accordingly. Trust in your team‚Äôs ability to the point that when it comes to structure, you can essentially run flat. This is a bold move, and it‚Äôs not for everyone, but we‚Äôre fortunate that it works for us. We don‚Äôt operate within an org chart of executives, managers, and supervisors. We have only leaders, and on any given project, anyone can step into a leadership role depending on their expertise or desire. This allows for huge growth opportunities for employees to explore and steer their career down the path of their choosing. When you trust your people and take the ‚Äúboss / employee‚Äù relationship out of the equation, everyone talks to one another as peers, and there‚Äôs a much closer connection throughout the team. It‚Äôs one of the reasons we named our company ‚ÄúINPHANTRY.‚Äù It‚Äôs very nice to suggest ideas, but it seems like we have to ‚Äúchange the culture regarding work culture‚Äù. What can we do as a society to make a broader change in the US workforce‚Äôs work culture? I touched upon this in my previous response, but I do think that less hierarchy goes a long way in building trust and accountability amongst the team. Ego is a big factor in many work cultures. We all want to feel important, appreciated, and respected, whether it‚Äôs at work or in our personal lives. When we‚Äôre not put in a position to be impactful, the ego suffers and it can become a problem. In a work culture, fewer levels between management and the team means that everyone has a clear role, a voice, and is adding value. You don‚Äôt need to be higher up the chain to make an impact. How would you describe your leadership or management style? Can you give us a few examples? My management style is a reflection of who I am as a person. I do not talk to my coworkers any differently than I would a family member or friend. I am honest, transparent, and straight to the point. If and when my coworkers make mistakes, I give them the space to learn from them. I also try to advise on how to accomplish something differently. More importantly, I believe that emotions should be expressed, not suppressed. If I‚Äôm happy or frustrated about something, I let others know ‚Äî and vice versa. None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that? I‚Äôd say my parents. They taught me what it means to be a decent human being. We grew up with very little, and I think that played a huge role in who I am today. It puts into perspective what we have now, and it makes you appreciate all of the little things. My parents are retired now but they still want to help out and contribute as much as they can. This is just the type of people they are, and whom I always aspire to be. They may not be very familiar with technology, or what I do on a daily basis, but they always want to support me in whatever way possible. Despite my best efforts to convince them otherwise, they won‚Äôt allow me to hire any cleaning or janitorial services. Instead, they come in themselves every Sunday to ready the office for the week and make sure the team has everything they need ‚Äî including a well-stocked pantry of snacks and goodies. If we need to build anything, benches, piping, tables or desks, they are here in an instant to help. This willingness to work hard and go the extra mile has shaped me ‚Äî not only as a person, but also as a business leader. How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? We try to contribute to charities and give back as much as we can. Every holiday season, we reach out to several local shelters and work with the staff to gather wish lists from the families there. We then go out as a team to spend the day shopping (no online shopping allowed) and bring back a huge haul of toys, clothes, and other necessities so that moms living in shelters can still give their children the holiday they‚Äôd hoped for. This is something we‚Äôre extremely proud of, and we never look to receive any recognition for it. Spending the day out as friends, and bringing some joy to children who really need it, is pretty rewarding as it is. Can you please give us your favorite ‚ÄúLife Lesson Quote‚Äù? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? ‚ÄúWork Hard, Stay Humble.‚Äù Having been raised by immigrant parents who sacrificed everything to give us a life here in the States, this quote defines who I am and where I‚Äôve come from. Being rich or successful is not something I can control, but working hard and staying grounded is. You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-) Ok, so this might be counterintuitive, seeing as I work in technology and marketing, but I‚Äôd love to inspire people to put down their phones and step away from social media more often. Obviously, all of this has changed the way we communicate and in some ways has brought us all closer together, but there‚Äôs no shortage of debate about the pitfalls of being forever connected to our devices. Anxiety and dopamine spikes aside, I would just like for us as a society to be reminded of the reasons for why we do the things we do. It‚Äôs not about the recognition, the likes, and the shares. It‚Äôs about who we are and what drives us. This has been a belief of mine for a very long time now; it‚Äôs one of the main reasons why we like to remain anonymous when we shop for the holidays. It‚Äôs why we request that the kids receive the gifts from their mothers and not from us. I saw a story in the news years ago about a man who would go into discount dollar stores and shelters, and hand out $100 bills to people in need. He requested that his face be blurred for the story and that he remain anonymous because he was fortunate to be in his position and simply wanted to help out and give back. That story always stuck with me. I still don‚Äôt know who he was, but he inspired me and I‚Äôll always be grateful for that example. Sometimes it‚Äôs ok to do something simply for the sake of doing it. Put down your phones, interact with people, appreciate the beauty the world has to offer. These days, it‚Äôs more important than ever. Thank you for these fantastic insights.

It is a mechanism for building a quality product that performs specific tasks and meets specific requirements. In this article, openGeeksLab has outlined why good software architecture is a must for your business. The tasks that a software product will perform affect architecture, but they are not crucial in defining it. Architecture will complete the task that needs to be performed. Questions arise concerning the requirements. Software architecture is selected depending on specific requirements and tasks. Separately worth noting the fact that if you assign a separate set of tasks, a development company can take for itself the most straightforward architectural product solutions. Therefore, businesses often have problems after a product launch. During testing, everything was fine. As soon as a project is released, in real conditions, when a load increases, critical situations arise, a software product ceases to cope with these problems since architecture is not able to comply with the requirements. There may be various software requirements for a product. Let‚Äôs take a look at the simplest types of requirements: Architecture is built based on requirements and functionality. Good architecture is one that meets these tasks and requirements and can complete them. Among other benefits, in addition to full compliance with the requirements, applying an architectural approach to the development itself provides certain advantages to your product: There is a concept of classical software architecture design patterns (classical architectural solutions). The most common are MVC, MVM, Viper, Flux, various service-oriented architecture (SOA) options, common query responsibility segregation (CQRS), and many others. On average, such solutions can meet approximately 80% of requirements. 20% are the most problematic, and the majority of time on architecture building is spent on them. These 20% are unique to your software product. As a result, the first proposal from developers for applied architecture will be available almost immediately. Accordingly, after a simple Internet search, you can find out the main advantages and disadvantages of the proposed architecture and discuss them with developers for further work. Classic is important not only for developers but also for a business owner. If developers can not give an answer, then it is worth considering whether to cooperate with them. It is important to understand that in different sources the same architecture can be described in different ways. For example, for SOA architectures, the most authoritative are Martin Fowler‚Äôs works. You are going to develop an application. Let‚Äôs say that your project requirements are: It is an example of a set of requirements without specifying the project functionality. When mentioning such tasks, an experienced architect would almost immediately refer to one of SOA software varieties, Martin Fowler‚Äôs microservice architecture using CQRS to reduce user response time. The main principle of development would be SOLID. You can google these items. When choosing some architects, it is reasonable to select among those who provide you with architecture that is built to last and who can ensure your system quality and longevity. We at openGeeksLab know everything about innovative architectural solutions and making fundamental structural choices to achieve your business goals.

Will the next ‚Äúvoice of a generation‚Äù be a robot?","Grimes: ""I think live music is going to be obsolete soon"" - NME Music News, Reviews, Videos‚Ä¶",Brian Larson,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Brian Larson Follow -- Listen Share Is art, in all its various human-led expressions, about to go extinct? Will art as we know it be supplanted by artificial intelligence (AI)? Will the next ‚Äúvoice of a generation‚Äù be a robot? **GASP** Some in the music community have recently started to debate this topic and I think it‚Äôs application can easily be viewed through the lens of the future of work. For example, many skeptics believe that ‚Äúthe bots‚Äù will supplant all forms of work in the future. This dystopian view is simply not true and, frankly, it‚Äôs unhealthy. Humans have learned from past industrial revolutions that advances in technology greatly improve the quality of human life while also contributing to more productive jobs (albeit some jobs do face elimination). What we see in the 4th Industrial Revolution is no different. The advent of ‚Äúsuperjobs‚Äù or humans working hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence and automation promise similar advances.[1] Grimes, a Canadian musician known for experimental but pop-laden music, is an outspoken futurist who has a rather dystopian view of the future of music and art in general. In a recent interview Grimes elaborated, ‚ÄúI ultimately probably believe in an AI dictatorship. I mean, I don‚Äôt think humanity is going to survive anyway. We‚Äôre f*c*ed. I think AI is the natural evolution.‚Äù Grimes furthered, ‚ÄúOnce there‚Äôs actually AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), they‚Äôre gonna be so much better at making art than us.‚Äù[2] www.nme.com Grimes‚Äô fear-infused future of art and, in particular, the music industry, are likely never to be realized. For starters, for hundreds of years, humans have been adapting to changes in technology and using such advances to better communicate their artistic visions (artists today like Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift have been known to lay down rough versions on tracks on their iPhones and, in Billie‚Äôs case, even fully record a song from the palm of their hand). Are the songs that are produced through such technological advances any different than those produced in a full-fledge music studio in LA or Abbey Road Studios? Probably not. Sure, mixing and mastering still need to be done in a studio, but the actual process of capturing one‚Äôs art in digital form has rapidly changed over the past 2 decades alone. Garageband is never likely to replace a talented producer just like autotune hasn‚Äôt replaced the need for incredible singers (leave Cher out of this argument- she‚Äôs untouchable with or without autotune). Holly Herndon, a Germany-based composer, has the right take on the future of music. Holly recently tweeted, ‚ÄúThe idea of technology and automation should allow us to be more human and more expressive together, not replace us all together.‚Äù Holly has proposed that ‚Äúinterdependent music‚Äù may be the solution to our AI-imbedded future. In a nutshell, Holly‚Äôs solution emphasizes using AI and other technological advances to facilitate ‚Äúhuman coordination‚Äù in music industry and to make sure that all parties in the ecosystem (writers, producers, singers, etc.) receive their fair share of the pie. This ecosystem of accountability and tracing of individual contribution (maybe there‚Äôs a place for blockchain in this process?!) to the finished product may sound idealistic but at least it offers a more salient solution than fearing the arrival of the overlord bots. Maggie Rogers, a Brooklyn-based and recently Grammy-nominated artist, known for infusing nature (yes, the sounds of leaves rustling, frogs croaking, and crickets chirping) into her infectiously-clever songs, has learned to embrace the change of technology while remaining true to her roots. Rogers noted in a recent GQ interview, ‚ÄúThe music industry is so cool because it‚Äôs constantly changing. Nobody has any idea what the f*ck they‚Äôre doing. A good idea can change the world. The music industry, and specifically the Internet and the way music is made now, democratizes that process. Someone in their bedroom could have a hit single because the Internet votes on it. The barrier to entry isn‚Äôt intense. You just need GarageBand.‚Äù[3] Can we all adopt Rogers stance on technology and nature‚Ä¶ and life in general? If you haven‚Äôt heard of Maggie Rogers or the below song (my personal favorite, ‚ÄúDog Years‚Äù) then please do yourself a favor and press play- the human connection is alive and well in every melody Rogers writes and produces (bot friendly, of course)!

Researchers Say it Exploits ‚ÄòSpurious Statistical Cues‚Äô,Published in SyncedReview,Synced,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Synced Follow SyncedReview -- Listen Share Since Google Research introduced its Bidirectional Transformer (BERT) in 2018 the model has gained unprecedented popularity among researchers. BERT has set new records on 11 natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and more than half of the top 10 models on the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) Benchmark are built on top of BERT architecture. Now, a group of researchers from the National Cheng Kung University Tainan in Taiwan are challenging BERT‚Äôs efficacy. Their paper Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments proposes that BERT‚Äôs impressive performance might be attributed to ‚Äúexploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset‚Äù and that without them, BERT may be no better than random models. The paper has been accepted by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The researchers introduced a new adversarial dataset that cut BERT‚Äôs accuracy from 77 percent to 53 percent, and suggest this dataset could be adopted as a standard for future performance evaluations. The NLP community has built benchmark tests such as SQuAD and AllenAI as well as evaluation metrics like GLUE to test the performance of models. In 2018, a group of German researchers introduced The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), designed to evaluate the inferencing ability of a language model. Given a premise/reason and a claim, the model has to infer to a warrant (why the claim follows from the premise) from two options. For example, given the claim ‚ÄúGoogle is not a harmful monopoly‚Äù and the premise ‚ÄúPeople can choose not to use Google,‚Äù the model should choose the correct warrant, which is ‚ÄúOther search engines don‚Äôt redirect to Google‚Äù and not the alternative, ‚ÄúAll other search engines redirect to Google.‚Äù Although the ARCT task raised the threshold for language models, BERT still scored 77 percent accuracy on it, only three points below the average (untrained) human baseline. That motivated the Cheng Kung University researchers to investigate why BERT works so well on ARCT. To their surprise, they discovered that the BERT model bases its predictions on spurious cues ‚Äî for example it tends to choose the warrant that includes the word ‚Äúnot.‚Äù Across the dataset, even a random model can achieve 61 percent accuracy if it simply keeps choosing the warrant that contains the word ‚Äúnot.‚Äù Spurious correlation was proposed in 1997, and denotes a mathematical relationship in which two or more events or variables are associated but not causally related. In this case, the word ‚Äúnot‚Äù is a type of spurious statistical cue that leads the model to choose the right answer but essentially has no causal relationship with the answer. Moreover, bigrams that occurred with ‚Äúnot,‚Äù such as ‚Äúwill not‚Äù and ‚Äúcannot,‚Äù were also found to be highly predictive. Researchers conducted additional experiments to test their conjecture. Previously, BERT had been trained on warrant-reason-claim pairs, but now researchers trained BERT on only the warrant data. It scored 71 percent accuracy, only six points below its peak performance. Researchers then created an adversarial dataset with the claims negated and the labels inverted so that the distribution of statistical cues was mirrored across warrant options, effectively eliminating the signals. This dropped BERT‚Äôs accuracy to 53 percent. The ACL paper is not the first attempt to rethink the efficacy of large-scale neural networks in NLP tasks. In fact, since neural networks were first applied to NLP, many language experts and linguisticians have been skeptical on whether deep learning models which can efficiently map latent representation from data are actually able to understand the semantics of languages. Earlier this year researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Brown University published a paper with similar conclusions: ‚Äúa machine learning system can score well on a given test set by relying on heuristics that are effective for frequent example types but break down in more challenging cases.‚Äù Some researchers have begun to question whether the machine learning community places too much emphasis on standard benchmark tests. Anna Rogers, a post-doctoral associate in the Text Machine Lab of Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts Lowell, wrote in her blog that ‚ÄúIf the reader‚Äôs main takeaway is going to be the leaderboard, that increases the perception that the publication-worthiness is only achieved by beating the SOTA.‚Äù Rogers suggests the machine learning community should come up with new evaluation methods that reward those who innovate on new architectures, rather than having teams compete against each other by simply enlarging their models or throwing more data and compute into their existing research. The authors stress their paper is not intended to disparage the value of BERT, which they regard as a strong machine learning system that can improve if the problematic spurious statistical cues are neutralized. ‚ÄúAnalysis of easy to classify data points showed reliance on a lower proportion of the strongest cue word than the BoV and BiLSTM ‚Äî i.e. BERT has learned when to ignore the presence of ‚Äònot‚Äô and focus on different cues. This indicates an ability to exploit much more subtle joint distributional information.‚Äù Google AI Researcher David Ha echoed this view, ‚ÄúI think the features learned using a model like BERT are still very useful for many applications, and it is good that such papers remind us of their limitations. Makes us take a step back from squeezing out small gains, and take a look at the bigger picture of what we are doing.‚Äù The paper Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments is on arXiv.

https://medium.com/@emilyklundberg/how-to-successfully-implement-new-workplace-technologies-8b8b47c5fc6a?source=tag_archive---------156-----------------------,How to Successfully Implement New Workplace Technologies,Written by Emily Lundberg,Emily Lundberg,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emily Lundberg Follow -- Listen Share According to an MIT study, 78% of executives believe upgrading their systems is critical for their organization‚Äôs ability to maintain a competitive advantage. Yet, 63% also said their organizations are slow to adopt new technology. Part of the reason they hesitate is that, though new technology is capable of producing huge gains, many companies don‚Äôt realize the full benefits due to poor implementation. One of the main reasons why companies fail is a lack of planning. You can‚Äôt just expect employees to take on the challenge of integrating a new tool into their workflow; you have to first provide proper training and messaging. Luckily, doing so is much easier than you think. Here are five strategies to help you successfully implement new technology in your workplace: Let‚Äôs dive in. Adopting new software has a significant impact on how your employees work thus, you should consider their opinions. While the question of whether or not to purchase a new software may be non-negotiable, give your employees a say in what specific solution you are buying. Once you‚Äôve narrowed down to your top two to three choices, email your team explaining why you‚Äôre interested in those options and invite anyone to research the tools and share their thoughts. Most employees will ignore your email but, the ones who care will make a case for why they prefer one tool over the others. Their feedback can be instrumental in helping you choose the right tool for your team. Plus, surveys find that employees who are involved in decision-making processes are more motivated, satisfied and engaged in their jobs. Giving them a say in the outcome transforms technology adoption from a disturbance that you force upon them to a collaborative effort to make the company more successful. If you‚Äôre struggling to narrow a list of tools that meet your business needs, check out our tools database. It‚Äôs a list of the most popular tools that our clients who range from soloprenuers to Fortune 500 companies use. How you describe new technology plays an influential role in employee attitudes toward it. You may have many metrics-driven reasons for the purchase; however, those alone are not enough to motivate your employees. We make decisions with the same part of our brain that controls emotions so, to convince your employees to embrace a new tool, you need to excite them by explaining how it solves their pain points. For example, if you‚Äôre adopting a more advanced CRM and one of your sales team‚Äôs top challenges is predicting which prospects and campaigns are most likely to drive sales, then explain how the new CRM has analytics tools that will help them determine where to focus their efforts. If you‚Äôre implementing software across multiple functional teams, change your message to reflect the specific benefits for each group. Read More: How to Capitalize on the 4 Types of Employee Motivation Humans naturally resist change, however, the extent that we do so varies. The Diffusion of Innovation curve explains that people‚Äôs willingness to adopt innovative technology falls onto a bell curve that‚Äôs divided into five groups of people: The percentage of your employees that fall into each of these groups may vary from the normal curve since your organization might attract people who are more or less open to change. However, you almost certainly have employees in all categories. Understanding the different perspectives on innovation helps you plan a smoother implementation. Here are the five perspectives on new technology: Innovators: These employees are always asking for new technology and proposing new ways to complete work. Give them access to the software first so they can learn how to use it and be able to teach other employees about it. Early Adopters: Early adopters curiosity is piqued when they see the innovators using something new. They are the employees who show interest in your new systems but aren‚Äôt as eager or change-driving as innovators. If you have time, create a 1‚Äì2 week long focus group from these individuals. Their questions, challenges, and positive feedback can be used to improve how you release the new system to the entire team. Early Majority: You‚Äôll reach the early and late majority when you roll out the new technology to everyone involved. People in the early majority will quickly jump on board and work collaboratively to develop best practices. Late Majority: People in this category will resist the implementation until they see proof that it works. They‚Äôll likely have a lot of questions and some complaints early on. However, once they start realizing performance improvements, they‚Äôll embrace the change. Laggards: These individuals will resist adopting new technology until you start punishing them for not using it. If possible, wait to force them to use it until you‚Äôve worked through most of the errors because they tend to be vocal complainers when they run into issues. Designing your implementation plan to cater to each of these groups will reduce the number of conflicts and resistance you face. Most Saas and other technology companies assign you an account manager. Take advantage of them; they are experts in the technology and can speed up your adoption process by helping you overcome the learning curve. Here are some questions you should ask your account manager: Ask as many questions as you need to feel 100% confident using the tool. If teaching your employees how to use new software is daunting, chances are you don‚Äôt have to do it yourself. Many Saas and other technology providers like Salesforce, Hubspot, Microsoft, etc. have free training programs that walk people through how to use every aspect of the software. Identify which sections are most useful to each of your employee groups and have your employees complete them. Though the training materials are great at explaining how to use the system, their assessments, if any, often aren‚Äôt strong enough to prove employee understanding. To ensure your team is learning the necessary skills, sync with them mid training to check their progress. After they complete it, give them an assignment that tests their ability to use it. For example, you might ask them to input data and run a few reports, use the analytics to generate actionable insights, or create a workflow to automate a process.

https://medium.com/phoensight/how-public-policy-can-thrive-in-a-data-world-ade1900698f1?source=tag_archive---------94-----------------------,How Public Policy can thrive in a Data world,Published in Phoensight,Audrey Lobo-Pulo,No Author URL,N/A,12 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Audrey Lobo-Pulo Follow Phoensight -- Listen Share With the emergence of new technologies, comes an opportunity to re-think public policy design. What I find really interesting is that we can do this by better utilising technology and using our ‚Äúhuman‚Äù attributes to greater advantage ‚Äî and I‚Äôm continually fascinated by how these not only complement, but enhance each other. Technology is rapidly disrupting our traditional policy approaches. And like people in most industries, policymakers are looking at new ways to adapt, with the two main factors in navigating this changing landscape being: Policymakers will soon integrate the two seamlessly, as new technologies become more familiar to us. What we‚Äôve seen is that the nature of these new technologies ‚Äî particularly the democratisation of technology ‚Äî also fundamentally changes how we choose to operate and interact with each other in society. And this is where the real paradigm shift happens! The Internet and Open Source technologies have created a world where it‚Äôs possible to share information (and code!) in an unprecedented way, that maximises accessibility to citizens while allowing for openness. High computational and processing power, along with sophisticated user interfaces and virtual reality, has the potential to offer citizens an opportunity to interact with their society like never before. Citizens may one day use new technologies to better understand their social and policy environments, and make more informed choices ‚Äî particularly if they have better insights into the impacts of policy decisions. If citizens could navigate their policy environment using technology the way I navigate through the city with my GPS, we‚Äôd have a better sense of the options available to us. Citizens may not need to know about the complexities of public policy design to understand how they‚Äôd be affected ‚Äî just as I may not know how my GPS works, but can still navigate to my destination! Technology ‚Äî and this iterative (and even real-time) feedback ‚Äî may add significantly to our tacit understanding of how our societal and economic systems work. Now, imagine a society where the public and stakeholders can co-design public policy with government, feel more empowered and share the responsibility of the decision making. The challenge here lies in knowing how to reach an intended outcome. The reason this has been so difficult is that it‚Äôs hard to know which policies will achieve their objectives, let alone the extent of their impact. And this is where the policy modelling story begins‚Ä¶ Policy modelling isn‚Äôt easy. In fact, most policy analysts know it can be something of a fine art. Judgments about assumptions, models etc. are all part of the craft, and it‚Äôs become more complicated and specialised. But the importance of quantifying policy impacts cannot be understated. Numbers and costings form part of the political armory in public debate and ‚Äî in the spirit of an open government ‚Äî should be up for public scrutiny. With this mind, perhaps the first step in a truly ‚ÄòOpen Government‚Äô is for governments to begin sharing their modelling‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòGovernment Open Source Models‚Äô refer to policy models released by governments that are freely available to use, distribute and modify by the public. The community would have the opportunity to improve the quality, reliability, and accuracy of policy modelling. And Government could use the incredible connectivity provided by the internet to tap into the multidisciplinary (and niche) knowledge of their citizens in the creation of these models. The result? New data-driven apps that are more developed, diverse, accessible and easier to understand. These would ultimately benefit the public through increased transparency, and add a new dimension (or rigour!) to public debate. So how can policymakers harness the full power of this potential? In an age where the debate on whether and to what extent machines can replace humans continues, there are two things I will always have sovereignty over ‚Äî my ability to experience and my urge to create. Our ability to experience and our desire to create is what makes us human. Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are a testament to our innate ability to be content creators, and our willingness to actively participate in our communities. Without an active member base, these companies would not be flourishing today ‚Äî and policymakers can learn from this! ‚ÄòGovernment as a platform‚Äô is also provided the same opportunity with their citizens. With technology it is possible to co-ordinate thousands of people in a collaborate effort on a single project! Wikipedia with 72,000 active contributors working on more than 48,000,000 articles in 302 languages demonstrated that community engagement at scale was doable. So how would policymakers use technology to collaborate with their citizens at scale in an ‚Äòopen policy design‚Äô process? Github is one of the most successful modelling (and software development) platforms to provide governments around the world a mechanism to co-ordinate with an unlimited number of contributors on a specific project ‚Äî and that is powerful! The possibility of governments working on specific policy projects with an unlimited number of citizens and stakeholders by collaborating at scale is yet to be fully realised. ‚ÄòScalable stakeholder engagement‚Äô is a way to transform government modelling by opening up new possibilities for open policy design. The potential is unimaginable! And we haven‚Äôt even got to ‚Äòbig data‚Äô yet‚Ä¶ In 1945, the French singer, Edith Piaf wrote ‚ÄòLa vie en Rose‚Äô, a popular French song about looking at life through rose coloured glasses. Now if you were to look at the world using a data lens ‚Äî what would you see? Transportation data, transactional data, banking data, weather data, social media data, photos, employment data‚Ä¶ and the list continues. Policymakers could not possibly imagine all the data sources we have today. Our data ecosystem is rapidly growing and diversifying ‚Äî but what does this mean for informing policy and social issues? How can governments uncover new insights and create a better society with such extraordinary data sources? Before we embark on a journey into the future, let‚Äôs reflect on how far we‚Äôve come with government data and data collection. One of the earliest recorded data collections ‚Äî the well-known biblical census ‚Äî required people to return to their own towns to register themselves. So Governments collected data on their citizens even back then! But a lot has changed since that time ‚Äî governments began to get more sophisticated, and organised their efforts into various ‚Äòportfolios‚Äô. And our data collection today is marked by these legacies ‚Äî data is usually collected by agency portfolio. Data collection has become ‚Äòsiloed‚Äô ‚Äî and this sort of partitioning of the data began fragmenting our data ecosystem. Today we realise that many of the policy and social issues we face require a ‚Äòsystems approach‚Äô. For example, education data is often correlated with employment data and it is unsurprising that the employment prospects for an individual usually depends on their education. We recognise that social policy issues like health cannot be considered in isolation without reference to income etc. or accessibility to healthier food options. The same applies to the data we collect within each agency portfolio ‚Äî to fully understand the nature of the policy issues, we need a systems approach to the data too. This has lead us swiftly towards ‚Äòdata integration‚Äô solutions of all sorts. A kind of ‚Äòputting humpty back together again‚Äô ‚Äî with all the complexities and challenges that come with it such as data privacy, ethics, regulations and legislation requirements. But the picture is even more complicated!!! Government no longer holds a monopoly on the data on its citizens - and I‚Äôd argue that Google, Facebook and many other private organisations hold the lion share of these data assets. And the citizen-data fragmentation we are faced with is much bigger than we‚Äôd ever imagined 20 years ago. What policy makers thought was their data universe has now expanded‚Ä¶ and is continuing to expand prolifically! Policymakers today have to work with not just government agency silos, but a public-private collective of information that could be utilised to create a better world. Yet, the richness and diversity of this data is also a policy analyst‚Äôs treasure trove! We now have such a diversity of information ‚Äî more than we‚Äôve ever known before! The challenge here is that it‚Äôs hard enough to know what data is being collected by whom, let alone how to gain access to it and bring it all together! But before we put this in the ‚Äòtoo hard basket‚Äô, let‚Äôs think outside the traditional ‚Äòdata boxes‚Äô. Although we seem to be dealing with a data linkage problem between disparate data sources ‚Äî we can turn the problem around‚Ä¶ And tackle this by examining ‚Äî not just the silos that fragment our data, but the silos that define our roles when we look at data. And this is *huge*. What we are talking about is the ‚Äòblurring out‚Äô of our organisational silos! Let me explain with a brief segue‚Ä¶ This is a picture of the famous ‚ÄòSky and Water‚Äô wood print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher in 1938. The central theme behind this picture is the equal proportion of birds and fish. According to Escher, ‚ÄúIn the horizontal center strip there are birds and fish equivalent to each other‚Äù. And it‚Äôs been claimed that this print has been used in the study of physics, geology, chemistry and psychology for the study of visual perception. Today we can use it for data and public policy! And we can look at this in two ways ‚Äì 1. Same data, different purpose. Data in and of itself can be used in many ways to answer many different questions. Private data collected in organisations is mainly used to provide new business insights and better customer/client services. But this same data, viewed from a different perspective, could also provide new policy insights that may be useful in designing and delivering better policy interventions. Data that looks like ‚Äòbirds‚Äô to private organisations may appear as ‚Äòfish‚Äô to policy makers. 2. Same people, different roles. Who are we? ‚Äî birds or fish? There‚Äôs a new trend in the workforce today -there‚Äôs evidence to suggest that employees are increasingly focused on contributing to a greater social purpose. Businesses are beginning to accept greater social responsibility ‚Äî and this is useful not just for social causes, but for organisations too. Allowing employees a greater sense of purpose in their work, allows for better employee and community engagement. This is already happening in some organisations today. Employees with access to privately held datasets are volunteering in their organisations to analyse their data so that they can contribute to the greater social good. Imagine a world where once we had Google‚Äôs 20 per cent time for innovation, we now have 10 per cent time where employees can actively contribute to their society through data! The result? A richer data ecosystem where individuals and entities co-create and share our social responsibility for the benefit of society. And by collectively putting the pieces of this puzzle together, we can start building better models of our social and policy landscapes. We can identify data gaps where collaboration and sharing between governments, private organisations and Not For Profits can really make a difference. We can create a new perspective of our society which, without sharing, would not be possible. And we are begnning to blur our traditional roles. But how do we begin to share data in a world that‚Äôs constrained (and understandably so) by concerns relating to data privacy and ethics? What‚Äôs at the heart of the issue ‚Äî is our ability and propensity to share. I am reminded of a quote I once read from ‚ÄòThe Inevitable‚Äô by Kevin Kelly ‚Äî and he says, ‚ÄúIf today‚Äôs social media has taught us anything‚Ä¶ it is that the human impulse to share overwhelms the human impulse for privacy.‚Äù And this reflection may point us towards a possible solution to our sharing problem. In a world where the limitations of our human cognitive abilities are augmented by technology, we have the opportunity to address the limitations of technology by augmenting it with what humans are good at! And we‚Äôre good at sharing stories ‚Äî data stories. We meet with people, we exchange views, we collaborate and we debate. We can also engage in a ‚Äòdata dialogue‚Äô, about social and policy issues we feel passionately about ‚Äî not just qualitatively, but in a quantitative way supported by data. Here‚Äôs a recent example: In October 2017, the Australian Treasury and LinkedIn embarked on a pilot project looking at the Australian labour markets. What began as a general question that interested both parties, turned into something much deeper ‚Äî a discussion that ventured into quantitative insights. But the challenge was entering into an open data-dialogue‚Äî a conversation where parties respected the rights and commitments to their citizens and members. In our current data environment issues such as data privacy and ethics are increasingly important, and rightly so, but we have yet to fully explore the human-side of what‚Äôs possible with data insights. In this pilot study tech entrepreneurship across 7 countries were examined: Australia, Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, the UK and the USA. And the most amazing part? Almost no data was exchanged between the parties. Each agreed to share the aggregate distribution of the demographic profiles, and this information was cross verified by comparing to census and national statistics data. Here was a situation that‚Äôs similar to a card game ‚Äî where parties have ‚Äòcards‚Äô that they cannot share, but where they can exchange insights that are mutually beneficial. And that‚Äôs exactly how some interesting and meaningful insights into tech entrepreneurship came to light. Let me tell you what was discovered ‚Äî although we are aware of the gender gap in tech entrepreneurship, it was surprising to learn how pronounced it was. The best case scenario occurred in Singapore, where for every 10 tech entrepreneurs only 2 were women. The results were eye-opening and brought many policy questions to the surface. And this was only the beginning ‚Äî the questions that followed, such as how this gap is distributed by education or age demonstrate that there is so much more to be gained in such public-private partnerships. Humans were able to get further into these social issues and so much more quickly, in this example, than more traditional data-driven collaborations. This work was presented at the 2018 Strata Data conference in London ‚Äî and the overwhelming feedback came from government agencies. They knew these data sources existed, and that they‚Äôd be useful - but assumed that data sharing would not be possible given the existing regulations, and so had never reached out. Here was a new source of information that was leveraged by ‚Äòhumanness‚Äô. So if you‚Äôre passionate about a particular social or policy issue, I urge you to venture further and engage in a data dialogue. You never know how these insights might impact the world we live in. And one day, we may be able to create new frameworks for these discussions, in helping us achieve the best outcomes for society. For public policy to achieve its true potential, we need to engage public participation at all levels and across all silos in society using our technological resources so that both may be enhanced in delivering a better world!

Microsoft, Adobe, etc took the lead. The 90s were all about building businesses online. Whoever could iterate rapidly and build products/businesses online, caught VCs‚Äô attention. Amazon, Google, eBay are such examples. Then, came the age of facebook & twitter and the winners were those who brought people together & built massive online communities faster than ever, we called it web 2.0. Then, Uber happened and since then, the theme has been to scale operations across geographies as quickly as possible. The boom is all about rapid industry shifts in a short period. There are overlapping between the phases but a couple of critical innovations grab all the attention and compel people to think along those lines. Extrapolating this, in the coming decade or two, we will see the next growth. And the winners will be those who will do/build ______ faster than ever. To fill this blank, let‚Äôs go back & understand the evolution which led to these shifts. 70‚Äì80s was all about building software but PCs coming to households led the software revolution. Companies building PCs made to the top too but the point to understand is, PC was a platform that provided access of the masses, to reach out to. Not just that, it changed the whole gaming industry. Businesses were going online in the 90s because the internet was the phenomenon. It led to setting up massive internet infrastructure. Not just setting up the broadband lines, but even the continents were brought together through sea-lines (SLOC). It provided internet access to a wider audience, which resulted in the formation of massive online communities. The Uber age was supported by the massive growth in smartphone adoption, around the world. If we extrapolate this, blockchain & other decentralized tech is another supporting infrastructure, a macro phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is & it will change the way businesses are currently being run although we are yet to see a mass level effect of this on the public at large, as no micro-level disruption has happened yet. So, what is it that we are not looking at! We have heard a lot about blockchain, decentralization, trustlessness, permissionlessness, which will require a separate post in itself for the explanation. But coming back to the point, what would it be, that blockchain would disrupt fundamentally, affecting the day-to-day life of individuals? What would the blockchain future be like? To get to the answer, we need to re-look history. If I ask when, according to you, the idea of internet incepted and when the first infrastructure was set up for the same. You probably would guess around the 40‚Äì50s the idea of the internet would have been conceived and 70‚Äì80s would have seen the manifestation of the idea into a product.But, that‚Äôs not true. Internet is just the transmission of information (data), an upgraded version of telecom. The idea is quite old. There are thousands of references for telecommunication, telepathy, teleportation, etc for ages. The first public infrastructure in that direction started with the telegraph which got replaced by electric telephone in the late 19th century. In the beginning, there was one telephone exchange that used to connect two parties on a call within a city then it progressed to multiple tele-exchanges connecting people across the cities and then continents. Initially, humans bridged these calls, then it got automated and then the hub & spoke model replaced by point-to-point communication. So, something which started as voice communication for humans completely shifted to today‚Äòs world of data communicating devices. Almost all the gadgets at the moment are transferring information way more to other devices than humans are transferring information to other humans. So, Bitcoin which was founded to enable trustless payments and other blockchain technologies that started with the aim to eliminate trusting 3rd parties is just setting the base to build protocols for establishing trust among the transacting devices. To understand the need for inter-device transactions, first, understand what trust is. Trust is a heuristic decision rule, allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning. In simple words, we trust because we don‚Äôt want to spend time, money and effort in understanding the complexities of something that we don‚Äôt know about (but want to get the job done). The Bitcoin revolution started with the developers‚Äô community. Developers understand the complexity of software. So instead of relying on a closed entity, working for its benefits, developers started relying on a community-driven, open and transparent payment system. But most of them still keep their crypto-assets in hardware wallets. So, entities are trusted for providing security, robustness and data privacy in the manufacturing of such wallets. If the intrinsic hardware complexities are well understood by the masses and the users start manufacturing these wallets at home, let‚Äôs say with 3D printers, they will no longer have to trust on such entities‚Äô claims. The idea of trust will shift. Now, to build a gadget, one will have to trust the silicon chip provider for providing robust quality chips. At the moment, it might look what could go wrong with the chip itself but we don‚Äôt know how fast quantum computing would progress, and invents atom level malware. So what I am trying to say is, the idea of trust is ever-changing for humans. However, the intrinsic notion of trust is non-existent in devices and, adhering to the pre-defined protocol rules is the way to establish trust for inter-device communication. At the moment, end-user devices communicate to trusted servers on certain protocols, similar to hub & spoke model of communication. These protocols offer secure and reliable communication but they lack capabilities to support inter-device transactions. The number of bits being generated by humans & devices is increasing exponentially day-by-day and the data has become the fuel of the 21st century. We have cheaper computation power and enormous data, We aren‚Äôt far away from the time when sophisticated, intelligent decision-making tools will start finding their way to everyone‚Äôs home. So coming back to where we started ‚Äî What is it which will bring disruption in the coming decade or two? You might have guessed it by now. The winners will be those who will make computers/devices learn skills, faster than ever. Designing an AI system is not much an achievement today but making system learn, is. A human-child learns things at some pace and to pass-on, the same learning to another requires similar if not the same, efforts & time. But a computer can pass its learning to its peers, in a split of a second. And the blockchain will provide the ideal platform to perform this. Think of it for a moment, that your computer or your device has some skills which it has learned over a period, on some proprietary dataset. In exchange for crypto-currency, your computer would pass this learning to some other computer or device without sharing the raw data. The blockchain will bring the transactional capability in the inter-device communication, for the devices to learn from each other. There will be open & transparent networks to authorize & validate such inter-device transactions to take place, which would need no manual intervention and no pre-established trust. To achieve this, the transactional nature in communication will enforce server-client networking to the peer-to-peer topology. It will be governed by consensus algorithms rather be governed by some 3rd party entity trust. The whole digital-learning economy will be formed around the transactions among the computer, gadgets, IoT devices & machines. The blockchain in the future is all about establishing the trust where it‚Äôs missing, in a trustless way. It appears to be an excerpt from a Sci-fi movie where machines are exchanging and learning skills automatically from one another and it might be little sooner to happen in the next decade but trust me :), two-decades is not a short time. -- -- Technology, Psychology & Spirituality and in no particular order.

Humbled. Proud. Those are a couple of sentiments shared by those that attended an LGBTQIA+ Hackathon last month. Pride is often marked by corporate rainbow-washing and endurance partying, but this event felt different. Using Tech for Good was the main purpose¬†for¬†us: build stuff to help the LGBTQIA+ community. In Tech, we have our own little super power‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith just a couple of hours of innovation, near shippable products can be built. Products that can sometimes change lives. On this day, the room was judgement free and full of superheroes. There were a complete mix of frontend, backend and UI developers, alongside Project Managers, Scrum Masters and graduates. After getting to know each other and hearing from the incredible grassroot queer charities, we put our powers to the test. Check out what we started! Personally, aside from seeing the community and charities benefit from all the goodness, the highlight of the event for me was feeling completely safe. Safe to create away from judgement, stereotypes or questions‚Ä¶it is so clear that we need more days like the #TechItForward with Pride Hackathon. Here‚Äôs to the next one! ‚ÄúRegardless of the early morning travel disruptions which reduced the number of people able to come, the hackathon was a blast. A particular highlight was the panel session in the morning which could have probably gone for the whole day. It was very endearing, humbling, and revelatory to hear the struggles all of these successful people have gone through to get to where there are. The conversation felt very honest which is not something that happens often with events like that. In general, the best thing about the hackathon was probably the atmosphere ‚Äî it was very refreshing to be in a room of people who felt comfortable being who they are and are there to just help some charities using technology, not to win a competition. In that regard, the event was unique. Not only were the participants comfortable, but the charities were also amazed and humbled to see so many people caring about their problems and doing their best to solve them. The work that these charities do is really admirable and I believe everyone felt very positive to contribute even a little bit to solve some their problems and make their lives a bit easier (especially Sean from AKT)‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my second Hackathon and I really enjoyed being part of it as it‚Äôs interesting, rewarding and educational. To begin with, we had a panel discussion, each personal story of the panelists was inspiring. My favourites were Meri Williams and Stephen Foreshew-Cain. My loosely formed team on the day supported charity http://lgbtiqoutside.org/, we helped fixing some frontend issues on the website. At the end, the charities were happy with the work that had been delivered within such a short timeframe ‚Äî they don‚Äôt usually have an army of professional IT experts. Their charities gained visibility throughout the event and some of the developers built a lasting relationship with them continued support. Although I wasn‚Äôt the main contributor as being a backend Java developer, there were a few lessons learned from my own experience and hopefully I can be better for the next one!‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel incredibly proud to have been part of the Hackathon here at Expedia with the Women Driven Development, which brought those from LGBTQI+ communities and allies together to hack solutions to their problems! It was a brilliant day from start to finish. The day started with an inspirational and thought-provoking panel of speakers: Stephen Foreshew-Cain (COO at Thoughtworks), Allie Fleder (Founder at Sherpa), Meri Williams (CTO at Monzo) and Chloe Davies (Head of Partnerships at myGwork). Our guests then spent the day (fueled with barista coffee and plenty of delicious food!) hacking to solve solutions to real life problems faced by charities ‚Äî all of which was captured by a professional photographer! The contagious positivity and excitement at the hackathon is articulated perfectly in the pictures from the day.‚Äù Thanks to Expedia Group and Women Driven Development for organising and hosting!

For those of you who don‚Äôt know who we are, Cashew is a B2B2C blockchain based SaaS platform that allows bank customers to purchase goods and services both offline and online. These cashless payments occur with a user‚Äôs mobile phone through the implementation of the service in the existing MobileBank applications. This allows banks connected to the Cashew service to quickly start using innovative technologies and provide their customers with new convenient financial services attached to their personalized checking account. With the help of QR code, facial recognition technology, and blockchain technology users can feel safe transferring funds to any merchant, bypassing two intermediaries: international payment systems and payment processors. This reduces the costs of merchants that to pay commissions to payment systems, thus increasing business efficiency. And thanks to blockchain technology, both businesses and users can feel safe and secure, creating strong trust in the platform. We are actively negotiating with large banks to implement Cashew service MobileBank Apps in Belarus. In fact, an agreement with one large Belarusian bank will be signed in the near future. We are also open to partnerships with all Belarusian banks that want to use Cashew. But most recently we have joined the Barclays Accelerator, powered by Techstars for the next 13 weeks in order to improve our strategy, help bring our product to market, and to attract investors. Together with top-managers of Barclays, Techstars, founders and leaders of large technology companies, and 9 other start-ups, we will take part in mentoring sessions and trainings to prepare for the accelerator‚Äôs ‚ÄúDemo Day‚Äù. ‚ÄúDemo Day‚Äù is the final stage of the program where Cashew will get up and present at an event which 200 investors are expected to attend.

https://medium.com/@HaeDeshaies/my-future-car-2025-2ff8e3ceb4f9?source=tag_archive---------137-----------------------,My Future Car ‚Äî 2025,Written by Hae Deshaies,Hae Deshaies,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Hae Deshaies Follow -- Listen Share The automobile is, now in a stage of reinvention. It perfectly suits the phrase ‚ÄòReinventing the wheel‚Äô which can be modified and put as ‚ÄòReinventing the tire‚Äô. Futuristic cars are envisioned to float on water, fly in the air and to extrapolate more, hover in space. Back in time, even though the advent of a brand new car created eye-catching headlines, some of the common facts such as the irreducible requirements of engine, transmission, suspension, and fuel tank, and all the mechanical linkages involved (pedal to throttle, driveshaft to wheels), dictated continued defining the look and overall functioning of a car respectively. Finally, car manufacturers realized the two conspicuous spectrums of technologies that drew a line between them and the traditional car design: driving-by-wire, and power from fuel cells. Automakers have already started to make early inroads in them and a revolutionized design will, shortly be in the public spotlight With automakers making a paradigm shift to power electronics, you will see the entire mechanical mechanism being at the helm of an intricate power circuitry. The transmission, the drive shaft and the interior encroachments will be a forgotten past. Perhaps most important, the internal combustion engine is likely to be superseded by a compact fuel cell which will transmit signals to the tires. You will find no catalytic converter anymore because these fuel cells will only emit vapor and water. Car designs in 2025 are envisioned to have its interiors without an engine compartment, fixed instrument panel, floor pedals, or even a standard steering wheel. You may see a car that will have a flat floor to work with, making it possible and tangible to create interiors that double as living and working spaces. With the present mindset, these innovations may seem to be a pie in the sky but in hindsight, they are going be the center piece for car maintenance. You may have a model that may be lighter than the combined weight of all its tires. These lighter models will obviously be made robust and durable. Sceptics have voiced their palpable concern that the fact that the concept of light models, materializing into total success, may be a remotest possibility because if they were to be run by fuel cells, the combined size of these fuel cells in the contraption will make it bulkier. Scientists, however, are feeling bullish to accomplish this unprecedented and unimaginable feat with the some extra flavour of technological craftsmanship. These light model cars are likely to alter the entire landscape of the automobile industry. Apocryphal designs are constantly being reworked to make them fully customized. Reinventing the automobile has indeed gathered unimpeded steam. This is also going to be true and decisively applicable to the tires. For e.g. in 2025, your car may have all season tires that will have varied sensors embedded inside their grooves. You may see an end to the seemingly endless problem of tire check-ups and replacements by retrieving every minuscule data from these embedded, delicate, and unnoticeable yet high-tech and profusely tech-savvy sensors. This approach will definitely prove intriguing as it will give the drivers a hassle free respite in steering the wheel manually all the time, especially during long, tardy drives. This high-definition technology will be made a mandate to all the cars because at the end, it will be highly eco-friendly. The implicated fixes and repairs can soon be a cakewalk and inexpensive. Now as a driver, you may not find it difficult to procure spare parts. You are going to have an easy access to garages and office depot. Some of the astounding, fanciful adjustments such as moving the passenger seat in any direction or turning a car into a mobile office, even a mobile bedroom etc‚Ä¶ are some of the unthinkable notions which are now very much within the realms of possibility. The elite group of automakers are encouraging the firms not only to play with interior configurations, but to fundamentally alter the architecture of the automobile, creating vehicles that are not only innovative but functional, shrugging off most of the manoeuvres done manually. The crux of the matter is to have the interiors potentially versatile so that they can accommodate major adjustments to make it gregarious. With an impeccable, immaculate in-built interior, the driving will be as smooth as a feather. As of date, a brand new concept of driving by wire technology is being worked upon under the aegis of the prominent automakers. What would this mean to a driver? He/she would enjoy the luxury of enabling the steering wheel to become an aircraft-type control yoke or a joystick. As silly as it may sound, but your future car may not have a steering attached to a conventional steering column and could, potentially, be docked in several places about the car. You can pull it down from the ceiling when required or hide it as a measure of security when your car is parked. When traveling alone, the driver may no longer be in a driver‚Äôs seat but can sit in the centre of the vehicle, as an increased safety measure in case of a collision; side- or rear-view cameras would provide a full range of vision. You may find a crash-absorbing, well-oiled structure replacing an engine compartment for making the cars safer during a collision course or freak accidents which will result in saving the passengers from a catastrophic fatality. After reading this, I am confident that we are all tempted to have a car that will strike a perfect balance between nonchalant driving and safety. -- -- I am an RF Engineer by profession, I do design and development on 5G network at Nokia, prior I have done various jobs in marketing, maintenance and education.

As of January 15th at 9:30 AM PST, VITE is confirmed for listing on this trading platform. Bittrex is renowned for its daily trading volume, reputation for security and focus on regulatory compliance. In mid-2018, Vite Labs closed funding through institutional capital without conducting a public crowd sale (ICO). Within six months, we built a team of 40 people in Beijing, Sunnyvale and San Francisco. We never outsourced talent and conducted no cosmetic marketing; our team insisted on doing the right thing and, this attitude of honesty and humility is paying off. 2018 was marked by speculative projects and investments, culminating in the recent bear market which we know as Crypto Winter. Bear markets are good for solid companies with sound technologies; we treat market volatility, including downturns in the overall blockchain industry, as positive moments in which mediocrity and hype are decimated. We have a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain solutions: a web wallet, iOS and Android wallets, decentralized exchange (DEX), online store powered by VITE, payment infrastructure without time lags nor fees, point of sale (POS) solution for merchants, smart contracts, one-click token issuance and a platform for decentralized applications (dApp). Our Test Net officially launched in November of 2018 and we expect our Main Net significantly ahead of schedule. Overall, our product team expedited the technical roadmap by an entire year. As a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) based blockchain, we had to address known security issues of DAG. Consequently, we invented the Snapshot Chain which is an overall ledger of all chains at the Local Consensus level (smart contracts and individual accounts) that maintains Global Consensus regardless of vulnerabilities within each smart contract and account. We focus on public sector and academic demographics because they control policy and education. It is commonly known that blockchain is applicable to enterprise use cases, particularly payment solutions, but we believe in serving a larger cause for mass adoption. By educating and assisting governments, specifically for blockchain adoption and investment, we hope to accelerate mass adoption on a socially meaningful level. By training and resourcing academics, particularly students and professors, we hope to create newly minted developers and curricula for blockchain mass adoption. Our partnership with the City of Syracuse Innovation Office, through Startup-In-Residence, is a manifestation of our belief in proving social use cases. We are exploring the utility of blockchain in creating a peer to peer micro loan platform to connect low income renters with people willing to provide short term loans without interest, for security deposits and other emergency housing funds. We are among 40 companies selected from 700 to work with 22 governments.

https://medium.com/@mnemosyne_echo/edtech-and-the-a-i-and-5g-mania-a395fe8335c?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,EdTech and the Mania over AI and 5G,Written by Mathew Black,Mathew Black,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mathew Black Follow -- Listen Share Has ISTE lost its way or is it being faithful to its true mission? ‚ÄúOnly a fool would blithely welcome any technology without having given serious thought not only to what the technology will do but what it will undo‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî Neil Postman, 1997 As an educator, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has always troubled me. In fact, I‚Äôve always thought that ISTE does the whole notion of EdTech a disservice. Its recommended standards, like all standards I suppose, seem oblivious to the nuances and individuality inherent in the teaching ‚Äî learning process by suggesting a mechanical implementation that leaves little room for a student‚Äôs process of personal discovery or application of critical thinking. They also come off as shallow, as if following trends rather than truly being at the vanguard of something meaningful. With 68% of its revenue coming from its annual expo, it‚Äôs hard to see ISTE as anything but a sales venue with its widely cited standards and education initiatives as advertisements. This would explain, for instance, why its CEO, Richard Culatta, sounds like a salesperson. More than a specific brand or product though, Mr. Culatta sells the idea of technology as a social tool for capitalism. This past August, during his keynote for ISTE‚Äôs annual conference and expo, Mr. Culatta was in fine form as the head of sales. Glossing over how the datafication of our lives impacts every aspect of our individuality and society, he resorted to clich√®s (‚ÄúWe are standing on the edge of a major transformation‚Ä¶‚Äù), cheap scare tactics (‚Äú‚Ä¶our students won‚Äôt have the skills they need‚Ä¶) and shaming (‚ÄúWe asked teachers to explain AI, 80% of them couldn‚Äôt.) to sell the crowd on the virtues and inevitableness of 5G networks and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Hearing and watching his ebullience over these technologies reminded me of Neil Postman‚Äôs lecture to the College of DuPage titled The Surrender of Culture to Technology, given in 1997. Back then, there was considerable excitement and energy surrounding the drive to ‚Äúwire‚Äù schools for the Internet and make sure that computers were available in every classroom. Considerable resources were spent and Mr. Postman addresses them with brilliant irony in his lecture. In the years since 1997, the benefits to learning by embedding digital technologies in the classroom remains debatable at best and in fact most independent evidence suggests that the presence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the classroom has a negative impact on student learning. Richard Culatta knows this but is perhaps swayed by his role in other companies that are heavily invested in Edtech initiatives to employ even the bare minimum critical thinking skills that should be on display at any event purportedly about education. Had Neil Postman heard him raving about the virtues of 5G networks and Artificial Intelligence, he would have surely encouraged Mr. Culatta to use the following questions to critically assess these new technologies. What is the problem for which these technologies are the solution and whose problem is it (that these technologies solve)? With 5G networks, Mr. Culatta says, we can ‚Äúdownload the entire eighth season of Game of Thrones in 30 seconds.‚Äù By that metric, 5G networks are apparently very fast. So there must be a problem in American schools regarding Internet speeds that is directly impacting student learning, right? The Brookings Institute recently asked itself a very similar question (albeit for entirely different reasons). ‚ÄúAre slow Internet speeds holding back American Schools?‚Äù According to its findings, only ‚Äú15% of school districts fall below the 250 KBPS threshold recommended by SEDTA needed for online learning.‚Äù In other words, a small percentage of schools in America lack enough connectivity to have all their students engage with online learning platforms simultaneously. Hardly a crisis. But the best part of the Institute‚Äôs report comes buried at the very end in an almost comical contradiction. ‚ÄúGiven the evidence that internet connections in the home and school are weakly related to student outcomes, it‚Äôs unlikely that slow internet speeds are preventing improvements in the classroom. However, there is a baseline level of internet access that schools need to function for administrative needs [‚Ä¶] and the FCC should continue this successful policy [of meeting broadband targets] rather than changing course and risking recent gains in school Internet speeds.‚Äù Students don‚Äôt need 5G netoworks and ISTE‚Äôs CEO knows this. ‚ÄúThe interesting thing about 5G networks that most people don‚Äôt realize,‚Äô‚Äô he shares, ‚Äúis that they‚Äôre not really being built for us, they‚Äôre being built for them (machines).‚Äù What he is referring to is the Internet of Things (IoT), the network that allows machines to talk to machines. ‚ÄúGartner says‚Äù, Mr. Culatta goes on, ‚Äúthat by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion smart devices on the planet [‚Ä¶] about three times the number of people in the entire world.‚Äù So 5G networks solve a connectivity problem‚Ä¶ for machines. ‚ÄúBut superfast connectivity is only part of the equation,‚Äô‚Äô Mr Cualtta explains. ‚ÄúWith these new applications comes an enormous amount of decisions that will need to be made way more than we have the capacity to make as humans [‚Ä¶] That brings me to the second technology that will change our world in the next couple of years and that‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence.‚Äù So AI solves the problem of data processing in a world of machines talking to machines, and 5G networks solve the problem of how those machines can share vast amounts of data between each other. In Richard Culatta‚Äôs own words, then, 5G networks and Artificial Intelligence don‚Äôt solve any problem that students, teachers or schools have, at least not in any way related to teaching and learning. Why then the 15 minute pitch to a crowd full of educators? He references a conversation with General Motors in which they express their concern over not having the labor force they will need to expand production in a future in which there are more machines talking to machines than people talking to people. To address this future short fall in workers with General Motors‚Äô required skill set, GM and ISTE partnered to help prepare teachers to help prepare students to be the kind of employees companies like GM will need. Very clearly and very tellingly he did not use his keynote in any way to address topics related to making learning meaningful to students but instead used it to make a pitch that was useful to corporations and in so doing revealed that for ISTE, technology in education, or maybe even education itself, isn‚Äôt about learning, it‚Äôs about training, and those are two very different things. Let us rephrase Neil Postman‚Äôs original questions, adapting them to the specific technologies promoted by Mr. Culatta. What is the problem for which 5G networks and AI are the solution? 5G networks allow machines to talk to machines and AI allows machines to process that communication. Whose problem is it that these technologies solve? It is a problem for corporations who wish to expand their markets by embedding 5G networks and AI in their products. And this leads us to Mr. Postman‚Äôs third question. What new problems might be created because we have solved the problem? We could refer to already existing issues of bias in algorithms, or to the kinds of exploitation of labor that can result from having algorithms perform managerial functions but perhaps the issue that should concern us most is Luciano Floridi‚Äôs concept of enveloping. In essence, enveloping is the process through which a particular environment is adapted for the sake of a technology‚Äôs performance. ‚ÄúWe envelop environments around simple robots to fit and exploit their limited capacities and still deliver the desired output. A dishwasher accomplishes its task because its environment ‚Äî an openable, waterproof box ‚Äî is structured (‚Äúenveloped‚Äù) around its simple capacities. Enveloping used to be either a stand-alone phenomenon [‚Ä¶] or implemented within the walls of industrial buildings, carefully tailored around their artificial inhabitants. Nowadays, enveloping the environment into an AI-friendly infosphere has started to pervade all aspects of reality and is happening daily everywhere, in the house, in the office, and in the street.‚Äù If we solve the problem of how machines can communicate with each other in increasingly complex ways, what new problems might be created because we have solved that problem? To paraphrase Luciano Floridi, these technologies risk constraining our physical and conceptual spaces, forcing us to adapt our bodies and our minds to the technologies because that is the best, or sometimes the only, way for these technologies to work. We therefore risk limiting humanity‚Äôs natural capacities for the sake of generating profits for technology companies. Well, at least it‚Äôs nothing we should worry about, which would explain why Richard Culatta didn‚Äôt feel the need to model any sort of critical thinking to a room full of educators. Fortunately for him and the Edtech industry at large, many educators and education policy makers are apparently not critical thinkers themselves. No wonder ISTE removed that strand from their standards in 2016. ‚ÄúThroughout the country we‚Äôre preparing to spend billions of dollars to wire schools in order to accommodate a computer technology and for reasons that are by no means clear. There certainly does not exist any compelling evidence that personal computers, or any other manifestation of computer technology, can do for children what good, well paid, unburdened teachers can do. Where then is the outcry from teachers? They are losers in this deal [‚Ä¶] American students already have an oversupply of sources of information. There are in America 17,000 newspapers, 12,000 periodicals [‚Ä¶] 500 million TV sets, well over 600 million radios (not including those in automobiles), there are 10,000 libraries and 40,000 new book titles published every year. Do American students now require an additional hundred million dollar investment to ensure that they become well informed citizens? [M]any teachers are thrilled by the thought of a hundred million dollar investment in computer terminals [and not in them]. Bill Gates loves this form of stupidity.‚Äù ‚Äî Neil Postman, 1997 -- -- Musician, teacher, artist and human.

However, this recognition is not very useful for its creators if it is not recognized legally that can prove ownership rights. This is so that the work is not easy to be recognized and commercialized by irresponsible parties. Copyrighted works have another name in their scientific language, intellectual property. Where this wealth does not only require physical protection, but also protection in terms of legality. Therefore Planchain is here to provide legality and monetization services by integrating Blockchain technology. Currently the work is not only in the form of goods or hardware, but now there are also works in the form of software, such as applications, computerized programs, trademarks, etc. Where all kinds of forms of intellectual property also require protection, both copyright and patent rights. This is certainly done as a form of appreciation for the hard work of its creator and also the work he has created. Currently there are a number of inventors or creators who have qualified knowledge to create a work. But not a few of those who do not understand how the concept of intellectual property protection itself. Therefore, with all its simplicity, Planchain invites us to understand how the system and procedures to protect intellectual property. The main step that must be done is to register an IP (Intelectual Property) on the official website of Planchain. Keep in mind that patents or copyrights do not matter who created them. But who first registered it. Therefore if you have a work that has a use value and high selling value, be careful when making publications and register immediately to get a certificate of ownership as Planchain will later provide. Speaking of proof of ownership, in fact you yourself have used it very often for the needs of daily economic activities. This certificate of ownership is, of course, the payment instrument or currency that you have been empowering all this time. If you pay attention to a banknote, there will be a number of stamps and signatures from certain financial authorities. These symbols do not directly explain that you are the owner. However, the instrument of payment is owned by a sovereign country and has the right to use it for the country‚Äôs economic needs. This also shows the financial identity of the country. The above phenomenon is the same as the IP you have. Where he also needed a certificate of ownership that proved effective in explaining his identity to the public. Seeing this, of course Planchain also has a proof of ownership printing tool with Vechainthor Blockchain technology and is accompanied by the addition of NFT for monetization services. As an IP protection service platform, of course Planchain also doesn‚Äôt work alone. This is because he has a professional business network which can certainly be a partner for IP owners or in being an intermediary if the IP owner wants to officially register his work at a government office. As with other cryptocurrency platforms, Planchain has PLAN tokens that can be used to access various services. At this time you can use the token if you register this certified IP on the Thorm. Where Thorm is like social media that promotes IP to be seen by investors who want to develop it. Therefore, as a creator you are also required to display the best portfolio that can attract attention from investors. Where later all transactions will be handled by the Vechaintor Blockchain and PLAN utility tokens. Currently Planchain not only provides proof of ownership and monetization of IP services. However, if you are interested in auctioning the IP work. So Planchain will also provide all kinds of facilities and infrastructures needed for this auction process. There are many reasons why an author decides to auction off his work, for example the auction results from the copyrighted work are used for social activities. One thing you need to know is that the auction process does not only end in the payment transaction. This is because the auction shows that ownership of the IP has changed hands and their royalties. Therefore we can say that the IP auction on Planchain has a continuous investment value. #PLAN_TGE_CONTENT Planchain information Website: https://planchain.io/ One pager: https://planchain.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/onepager-28-08-2019.pdf Telegram: https://t.me/Planchain MY BTT URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2579599;sa=summary -- -- Moving in the shadow of time Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PTWMGavHWOk7Dt7rCfJerA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PTWMGavHWOk7Dt7rCfJerA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PTWMGavHWOk7Dt7rCfJerA.jpeg"

Now, not so much. In fact, not at all. Siri, Alexa, Cortana and the Google assistant have become household names today. We live in a digitally evolving world, and this evolution is primarily fuelled by disruptions in technology. Conversational commerce backed by artificial intelligence and machine learning mechanisms have become so common today, that it‚Äôs hard to imagine our day to day lives without them. The numbers speak for themselves. A Juniper research states that the voice assistant market is all set to cross $8 billion by 2023. Along with smartphones, the smart TV category has also added to this growth, as more and more consumers want entertainment at their fingertips, whenever and wherever they go. And if you thought the millennials were the ones driving this trend, you‚Äôd be wrong. The maximum adoption is seen in the 55‚Äì70 age group, as they find it more convenient to converse, rather than use text commands. We Indians especially love talking. Our country has a 72% adoption rate when it comes to voice assistants! Why use them in the first place? The usage of voice assistants varies by context, but most commonly, they are used to perform general searches. Due credit to be given to the backend machine learning systems for this, that can understand different styles of speaking, vernaculars and tonalities. It‚Äôs easier to ask ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the weather like today‚Äô than search for your city and state from among a list of thousands. Playlists can be made, alarms can be set and recipes can be looked up instantly, in the blink of an eye. A little over fifty years ago, we would struggle to fit supercomputers into one room, and now we don‚Äôt even need to touch the technology anymore! I find that incredible, and the evolution has almost been invisible. Voice assistants are much better at anticipating consumer needs than text based systems, and anticipating their responses as well. I foresee them having a potential of way beyond addressing immediate, functional needs. Brands who can factor in the emotional aspect will be the ones who optimize the usage of these assistants, and trust me, it‚Äôll help them grow by leaps and bounds! How can they make people‚Äôs lives even more simpler? The two industries that are the most stressful to work for, are hands down healthcare and e-commerce. Both require great anticipation skills, and deal directly with sensitive consumer data. When it comes to healthcare, voice assistants can provide patients with round-the-clock care on demand and a cheaper alternative to in-office visits. Personalised healthcare is catching up fast, and is supposed to be the next big thing by 2030. Data entry and segregation which is an otherwise manual, cumbersome process can also be automated with the help of these assistants. Hospitals can then optimize admin spends, and allocate more budgets for R&D. The data they collect also has a potential to treat diseases from previous diagnoses and patterns, which means more staff time with patients, leading to better care. When we think of e-commerce, online shopping has existed for almost two decades now. Old news. What‚Äôs new is the possibility of intuitive shopping experiences, where most online retailers can make deft use of voice ordering as an opportunity. Voice assistants are an excellent way to track consumer behaviour, almost in real time. Data mined with assistance from predictive analytics can also contribute to building brand recall. Right now, all this is just in the stages of infancy, so imagine what happens when this escalates! Is the risk worth it? Consumers more or less like their personal assistants, but frustrations and worries exist. All good things come at a price, and in this case, that cost is your own data. The risk of sensitive data falling into the hands of the wrong people and organisations is surely a looming threat. This is the reason that consumers in the healthcare and ecommerce domain are not making much use of voice assistants. Especially when this data includes things like medical records, bank statements and credit card information, organisations need to be very careful in the way they analyse and use this data. One breach is all it takes to wash away years of trust. And today, one consumer is enough to bring the whole business down, thanks to the power of social media. But here‚Äôs the thing. In my opinion, the smarter we are about this technology and the more we use AI and ML to refine assistant-consumer interactions, the further it will take us. Consumers are very aware of the risks entailed, but convenience overpowers everything. JARVIS is going to become a reality pretty soon.

NEO is a leading protocol that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identities to tokenize assets and automate the management of tokenize assets using smart contracts. The recent update to NEO 3.0 allows it to scale and build a fully-integrated tokenized economy. ‚ÄúIt is important to develop a security token standard while the industry is still in its infancy. What separates NEO apart from other public blockchain protocols is the integration of NeoID, which allows KYC, AML and accreditation status to be stored on-chain while maintaining privacy. This allows issuers to monitor and maintain records of all transactions in the secondary market to remain compliant in multiple jurisdictions,‚Äù Adrian Lai, CEO of Liquefy. ‚ÄúWe are excited to welcome NGD as an investor and a partner to develop a security token ecosystem together and bring innovation to the financial market.‚Äù The Liquefy Platform will support NEO which will allow NEO stakeholders to gain access to the security token universe. The current process of transferring private securities is fragmented, cumbersome and expensive since KYC information of investors are siloed across multiple intermediaries and compliance is a manual process. Liquefy is solving a critical pain point in the market by providing an end to end solution from issuance, managing compliance across multiple jurisdictions to investor management services. The investment and partnership with Liquefy have cemented NEO‚Äôs commitment to develop the security token industry. Earlier this year, NEO had formed the Digital Asset Alliance (DAA) to explore, develop and share insights about the security tokens sector with a consortium of industry leaders such as Republic, Globacap, DLx and Liquefy. About Liquefy Liquefy is an end-to-end technology solution that provides a seamless experience for asset owners to create security tokens. The core offerings include tokenization technology, digital register of members and corporate action management tools.

https://medium.com/hmif-itb/pengenalan-terhadap-ray-tracing-51823217f06?source=tag_archive---------69-----------------------,Pengenalan Terhadap Ray Tracing,Published in HMIF ITB Tech,Shandy Gunawan,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shandy Gunawan Follow HMIF ITB Tech -- Share oleh: Shandy ~ Teknik Informatika ITB 13516097 Peluncuran kartu grafis dengan kode RTX oleh Nvidia beberapa waktu lalu mengenalkan istilah baru kepada publik, yakni ray tracing. Akan tetapi, istilah ini masih belum banyak dimengerti sehingga publik mengira bahwa ray tracing adalah fitur Nvidia terbaru. Ray tracing sesungguhnya adalah sebuah teknik pembangunan gambar dari model (rendering) yang mampu menampilkan efek cahaya yang sangat realistis dan sudah banyak digunakan di industri film. Pada tulisan ini, kita akan menelusuri lebih jauh mengenai ray tracing, termasuk aplikasinya dalam bidang komputer grafis. Sejak tahun 1990, pemodelan 3D konvensional menggunakan proses yang bernama rasterization. Proses ini menggunakan kumpulan segitiga dan poligon untuk membuat model objek tiga dimensi. Kemudian, model tersebut dikonversi lagi menjadi pixels dan dilanjutkan dengan berbagai post-processing sebelum menjadi gambar akhir yang akan ditampilkan ke layar. Mengutip dari web resmi Nvidia, ray tracing mampu mensimulasikan perilaku fisik cahaya. Ray tracing mampu mengkalkulasikan warna dari pixels dengan menelusuri jalur yang ditempuh cahaya seolah-olah tampilan layar yang ditonton berasal dari mata penonton sendiri. Berbagai perilaku dari cahaya seperti refleksi, refraksi, dan bayangan menentukan warna akhir dari setiap pixel di layar. Hal terpenting yang kita butuhkan untuk menciptakan sebuah gambar adalah sebuah permukaan dua dimensi. Kemudian, kita dapat meng-visualisasikan permukaan tersebut sebagai dasar sebuah piramida horizontal dengan puncak (vantage point) piramida tersebut terletak di tengah mata kita dan tingginya sejajar dengan arah pandang (line of sight) kita. Dasar piramida tersebut kemudian kita sebut sebagai image plane atau canvas. Ilustrasi berdasarkan visualisasi tersebut antara lain sebagai berikut. Image plane ini berfungsi sebagai permukaan dua dimensi yang akan kita gunakan untuk memproyeksikan berbagai tampilan tiga dimensi. Sebagai contoh, jika kita ingin menggambar sebuah kubus tiga dimensi pada sebuah image plane maka kita perlu menggambarkan garis-garis yang saling menghubungkan titik-titik sudut kubus yang terlihat oleh mata. Pada gambar berikut, titik-titik sudut tersebut diberi nama c0, c1, c2, dan c3. Setelah itu, kita menarik garis dari masing-masing sudut tersebut ke vantage point yang merupakan mata kita. Perpotongan garis-garis tersebut dengan image plane juga membentuk titik-titik sudut yang akan merepresentasikan kubus tiga dimensi tersebut pada image plane. Titik-titik sudut tersebut kemudian disebut c0‚Äô, c1‚Äô, c2, dan c3‚Äô. Persegi hasil proyeksi tersebut yang akan ditampilkan pada layar dua dimensi. Metode diatas dinamakan sebagai perspective projection yang berfungsi untuk menerjemahkan objek-objek tiga dimensi yang kita lihat sehari-hari menjadi dua dimensi. Setelah kita mampu menggambar outline dari objek tiga dimensi pada sebuah permukaan dua dimensi, kita mampu menambahkan warna pada gambar tersebut. Seperti yang kita ketahui, kecerahan dan warna adalah hasil dari interaksi cahaya dengan material objek. Cahaya terbentuk dari photon mampu diserap, direfleksikan, atau ditransmisikan oleh objek-objek yang berinteraksi dengan photon tersebut. Besar persentase photon yang diserap, direfleksikan, dan ditransmisikan oleh berbagai material objek menentukan bagaimana objek tersebut terlihat oleh mata. Sebagai contoh, cahaya putih terbentuk dari photon RGB (Red, Green, Blue). Jika sebuah objek berwarna merah maka material objek tersebut menyerap photon Green dan photon Blue tetapi merefleksikan photon Red yang akan ditangkap oleh mata dan menerjemahkannya menjadi warna merah. Perlu diingat bahwa contoh diatas hanyalah simplifikasi, photon tidak sesungguhnya bersifat RGB. Selain itu, tingkat kecerahan dari suatu objek yang berasal dari jumlah photon yang dipantulkan juga memberikan dimensi lain bagi mata untuk merepresentasikan objek tersebut, seperti shading. Melihat pentingnya cahaya bagi penampilan objek, ray tracing dapat dikatakan juga mempunyai peran penting dalam menentukan penampilan gambar ke layar monitor kita. Ray tracing dinamakan demikian karena metode tersebut mensimulasikan jalur dari sinar cahaya (light rays) berasal dari sumber cahaya menuju mata manusia. Tujuan yang ingin diraih dari ray tracing yakni menentukan warna dari light rays tersebut, terutama jika light rays mengalami banyak pantulan dari berbagai objek. Penjelasan diatas akan jauh lebih mudah dipahami melalui gambar berikut. Seperti yang telah kita pelajari di sub-bab sebelumnya, kita melihat objek tiga dimensi dalam dua dimensi melalui image plane, dan warna objek diperoleh dari warna yang direfleksikan oleh material objek tersebut. Pada gambar diatas, terdapat suatu sumber cahaya, misal sebuah bohlam lampu, yang memancarkan cahaya ke segala arah. Jika kita melakukan tracing pada cahaya tersebut dari bohlam lampu maka kita akan dihadapi dengan beberapa pertanyaan: Pada ilustrasi diatas, garis panah utuh adalah sinar yang mempunyai jalur menuju ke mata, baik langsung maupun melalui pantulan, sedangkan garis panah terputus-putus adalah sinar-sinar yang tidak menuju ke mata. Tugas kita yakni mampu memilih sinar yang mempunyai jalur seperti garis panah utuh karena melakukan tracing pada sinar yang tidak menuju mata hanya akan menguras resources. Pertanyaan-pertanyaan di paragraf sebelumnya membuat tracing sinar-sinar yang terjamin menuju ke mata sangatlah sulit. Akan tetapi, jika kita melihat permasalahan tersebut secara terbalik (backwards), solusi dari permasalahan tersebut sangatlah mudah. Solusi tersebut yakni kita melakukan tracing sinar-sinar tersebut bukan dari bohlam, tetapi dari mata. Sebagai contoh, kita memilih sebuah titik pada image plane yang ingin kita ketahui warnanya. Warna dari titik tersebut berasal dari light ray yang menembus titik itu. Kita mampu melakukan tracing mulai dari mata, lalu menembus titik tersebut, dan seterusnya hingga mencapai sumber cahaya sehingga kita dapat mengetahui warna dari titik tersebut berdasarkan material objek-objek yang menumbuk tracing kita. Metode ini disebut sebagai backward tracing yang dapat diilustrasikan sebagai berikut. Algoritma Ray Tracing mengambil sebuah gambar yang terbuat dari pixels. Untuk setiap pixel-nya, kita menembakkan sebuah sinar utama (primary ray) menuju image plane yang berasal dari mata. Kemudian, kita melakukan tracing pada sinar utama tersebut untuk menentukan arahnya dan objek-objek yang tertumbuk oleh sinar tersebut. Pada kasus tertentu dimana sinar utama menumbuk lebih dari satu objek, kita memilih objek tertumbuk yang paling dekat ke mata dan menembakkan sebuah sinar bayangan (shadow ray) dari titik tumbukkan pada objek tersebut menuju sumber cahaya seperti gambar dibawah ini. Jika sinar bayangan tidak menumbuk objek lain saat menuju sumber cahaya maka titik tumbukkan tersebut terkena sinar langsung. Sedangkan, jika sinar bayangan menumbuk benda lain, maka titik tumbukkan tersebut dibayangin oleh objek yang ditumbuk oleh sinar bayangan. Jika kita mengulangi proses ini untuk setiap pixel, kita akan mendapatkan sebuah representasi dua dimensi dari sebuah pemandangan tiga dimensi. Berikut adalah implementasi algoritma ray tracing dalam bentuk pseudocode. Sesungguhnya materi-materi yang telah dibahas diatas hanyalah tip of the iceberg dari ray tracing yang sesungguhnya. Kita mampu mengkalkulasikan refleksi, refraksi, dan sifat-sifat cahaya lain untuk menghasilkan gambar yang semakin indah dan akurat dengan fenomena cahaya yang sesungguhnya. Oleh karena itu, penulis menganjurkan untuk membuka referensi-referensi yang digunakan oleh penulis untuk memperdalam wawasan pembaca mengenai ray tracing. Hayward, Andrew. (2018, March 21).

Soon after, she met a woman who became her ‚Äúpal‚Äù, her BFF, there. They began having tea and cookies in one another‚Äôs rooms in the afternoon. As Grandmothers will do, they began comparing stories about their families. ‚ÄúWait, you have a single grandson?!‚Äù Paula‚Äôs friend, Molly, said. ‚ÄúI have a single granddaughter.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, is there something we can do about this?‚Äù the two thought. Not long after that, I got a call from my Grandmother one evening. telling me that there is a woman in her building, whom she likes very much, and that woman has a pretty granddaughter (she had seen her picture), whom I should take out for a nice dinner. Oh, and, I should call my Grandmother more often. I was working long hours, as a corporate lawyer in San Francisco, in my thirties and not dating anyone at the time, but wanted to. So, I called this girl. As it turns out, she was on a date at the time I called, but called me back and we laughed out loud that our grandmothers clearly liked one another, were clearly up to something, and maybe we should just ‚Äúhumor them.‚Äù We had a really nice dinner at a local French bistro, she gave me a really nice kiss goodnight, we had another date, and . . . about a year later, we were getting engaged. What can I say?! It just took. In 2003, we got married and now have 3 beautiful kids together. We‚Äôve since each gone our separate ways, but we have been asked, frequently, by good friends, if we could do for them what our grandmothers did for us. Naturally, we always answered that call to action with generosity and enjoyed helping friends of ours find their next great love, or, much more often and likely, just their next great date. What our Grandmothers were doing was what the Jewish tradition calls ‚ÄúShidduch‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcreating connection between two people who deserve to be connected. It‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúmitzvah‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa good deed. So many other cultures share this beautiful tradition, it‚Äôs really nearly universal, but when I became single again, I was amazed that there wasn‚Äôt an easy way to ask my social network to help in this way. I know plenty of people who would, if I simply asked them. And I know I would, if you just asked me. That‚Äôs how and why Match Me was born! Because algorithms don‚Äôt create connection between people nearly as well as people do. In the sphere of creating and sustaining human connection, we believe that Emotional Intelligence is often more helpful than Artificial Intelligence.

They have become buzzwords ‚Äî overused, sometimes wrongfully applied, and downright bastardized. Each one of the aforementioned terms could have a guide of its own, but today we‚Äôre going to focus on services. In general, the word is a mess. Merriam-Webster has 11 different definitions for the word alone, and that is only for the noun format. Tack on adjectives and verbs, and you have a plethora of meanings for service. Without setting the proper context, you can see how easy it could be to misconstrue the meaning.

The companies applying technologies can be both for-profit, such as Givv, and not-for-profit but they have a common aim to improve the effectiveness of non-profit organisations and ultimately better the global human experience. Next Gen Technology for Good Over the last decade, the discussion on non-profit technology (#nptech) and next-generation technology for good has been primarily around social media, mobile technology, and online fundraising. As technology and connectivity enter the next phase, non-profits could benefit from better understanding some of the concepts that will shape the world in the decade to come. Technological advancements have changed how we improve standards of living and fundraise for causes, but new tools can provide global scalability and even change how we volunteer our time. There a several projects currently in existence that use technologies such as AI, blockchain, internet of things, cloud computing and even distributed computing to improve our current methods of improvement. How to Improve Non-Profit Funding Through Technology Non-profits like any other organization are looking to capture as many eyes as possible and bring in as much money as possible. So adapting to current technology is a no brainer, such as using social media platforms to bring awareness and accepting online donations or crowdfunding to raise capital. While this has shown significant improvement, 63% of people admit they don‚Äôt give to charity because they do not have the financial resources or they volunteer in lieu of donations. As we allow technology to improve every aspect of our lives, why not facilitate the process of giving to your fellow man. Not to discourage someone from giving up their time, as that is the most valuable thing a person could spare, but some of us just don‚Äôt have enough of it free to make a significant impact. Allow Givv to save you time and money by simply donating your computing capacity, instead of your time, and putting away those hard-earned dollars in your savings. Givv Innovates in Creating a For-Profit Technology for Good Givv is a distributed computing project that lets anyone with an internet connected device donate their idle computing power, which can generate up to $10 a month, and direct it to non-profits. Other distributed computing projects like Folding@home, the largest distributed computing project today, conduct disease research that simulates protein folding. Or Seti@home, the second largest, an internet-based public volunteer computing project searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. These projects use the idle resource of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world, they have 8 and 5 million active processing units, respectively. Givv is much larger in scope, aiming to be a method of recurrent funding for any and all non-profits, mobilizing a larger category of people to close an enormous funding gap that would allow everyone to improve their standard of living. Givv is a for-profit technology company that facilitates funding for non-profits around the world. Givv uses blockchain, AI and cloud computing to aggregate idle computing power and sells it to companies in the market for computing capacity. Givv then directs all revenues to non-profits advancing the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals. Givv is building the largest cloud computing network in the world and in doing so will become the greatest source of recurrent funding for non-profits. Truly a for-profit technology, aimed at bettering the process for non-profits and ultimately bettering the world.

Consuming freshly made juices at home is the best way to absorb all those nutrients and vitamins packed in the fruits. But which juicer to choose? Which technology? Centrifugal or Cold Pressed? Wait, what? There are two different types of juicers? You heard (read) that right! With the constant advancements in technology, it is not surprising to see that even the juicing technology has got a boost. So, before we begin to decide which is the juicer you should go for, how about a little background on both of them? Centrifugal Juicers These juicers are the ones you are aware about. Chances are that you even have them at your house. These are the juicers that use blades, rotating at high speeds, to cut the fruits against a mesh to produce the juices. While doing so, the juice and the pulp are separated. That‚Äôs centrifugal for you. Cold Pressed Juicers The way these juicers work are that they crush the already cut fruits and vegetables (yes, vegetables!) and press them at intense pressure levels to derive the juices out of them. So, which is the better technology? Cold Pressed Juicers have distinct advantages over their centrifugal counterparts. In Centrifugal Juicing, due to the mechanical nature of the blades moving at high speeds, heat is produced. Coupled with this heat, the juicers also incorporate air in their process causing oxidation. This oxidation leads to the destruction of important nutrients that are present in the fruits. Cold Pressed Juicers however do not employ such processes and thus the juices derived from them are much more nutritious. The problem with centrifugal juices is that you need to consume the juices right at the moment it is made. However, as Cold Pressed Juices retain most of the enzymes (as their parent fruit), they degrade very slowly giving them a shelf life of about 3 days! I had mentioned that the Cold Pressed Juicers even process vegetables. Is it really a big deal? Ask those who are into nut milks and green juices! Cold Pressed Juices can process vegetables like spinach and dry fruits like almonds to give you that super nutritious drink you have been paying brazen amounts for! Cold Pressed Juicers also produce more quantity of juices from the same fruit than a normal conventional centrifugal juicer. And if that‚Äôs not enough, they also create way lesser noise! In the days of noise pollution, you do not need one more appliance to lend a hand to the cacophony. This is not to say that Cold Pressed Juicers are for everyone. They are expensive and they take relatively a lot of time to make juices compared to the centrifugal juicers. However, if health and nutrition is your primary concern, Cold Pressed Juicers are the way to go. Disclaimer ‚Äî I used to intern at a Cold Pressed Juicer company called Kuvings. That is how I know a few things about Cold Pressed Juicing. In no way am I connected to them. Thanks. -- -- Just a normal (hopefully) guy trying to understand why we do what we do.

https://medium.com/@heitkamp/diversifying-tech-76a9db04032b?source=tag_archive---------79-----------------------,Diversifying Tech,Does tech just need to get more diverse or should we also rethink what tech is to make it more inclusive of diversity?,Steve Heitkamp,No Author URL,N/A,10 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Steve Heitkamp Follow -- Listen Share Not long ago tech companies tried to attract talent by out geeking each other, parading nerdy young guys as the world‚Äôs new superheroes. Over the past 10 years, however, diversity and inclusion have come to be valued by even the least diverse tech companies. In the past 5 years companies have started publishing data on how effective they are at actually becoming more diverse and inclusive. Despite these significant changes, efforts have plateaued, at least as evidenced by company diversity data. Some blame pipelines (not enough diversity in STEM) and others say it is about retaining diverse talent. Most everyone agrees that increasing diversity and inclusion at tech companies is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Yet, in a space where failure is a right of passage and iteration and pivoting are norms, few people are questioning the roles that exist at tech companies. It is assumed that tech companies are mostly Engineering + Sales (or Tech + Business). But as consumers and legislators start to ask how companies are leveraging user data and the frailties of systems built only to optimize clicks and ad sales are exposed, it might be time to think more broadly about the roles a tech company needs to have. Maybe it is time for tech companies to start hiring for data ethicists, human empowerment specialists, and even product and data compliance officers. Some companies are already doing this: Lever has Trust & User Operations Associates, Indiegogo has Customer Success Managers, and Clover Health has Data Stewards. These companies also happen to be some of the most diverse and inclusive within tech. This role diversification will require new hiring pipelines, broadening the hiring pool, and bring in new ways of thinking about technology. Combined this could help to create positive feedback loops that improve diversity and inclusion in tech while also helping tech companies better prepare for evolving expectations from regulators and customers alike. This won‚Äôt ‚Äòsolve for‚Äô diversity and inclusion in tech and is not an alternative to efforts to increase diversity specifically within technical roles, but it may help to break down the challenge differently while also helping to build tech companies that are more thoughtful about the diverse communities they want to serve. While not all tech companies value diversity equally, today most of them at least support the idea that diversity within tech is desirable. In the UK, for example, many companies take the legal requirement to publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap as an opportunity to emphasize their commitment to all things diversity. A cynic might ask how many of these companies submitted reports prior to the requirement. I think we can all guess the answer: not (m)any. Setting cynicism aside, however, the increase in public affirmations that diversity and inclusion are valuable is a step in the right direction, even if it only a very small step on a very long path. As Megan Rose Dickey wrote in a recent TechCrunch article on The Future of Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, just over 10 years ago questioning the Silicon Valley old boys club was seen as risky. Today it is welcome. More recently, when I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2015 the idea of publishing diversity reports and basic data was seen as pretty cutting edge for tech companies. Google, for example, first began publishing a Diversity Annual Report in 2014. And GoDaddy, which had previously made a name for itself through a series of truly nauseating ads, was getting a lot of press for its efforts to transform itself from one of the most toxic and least diverse and inclusive tech companies around to one of the most diverse and inclusive companies. Of course, diversity reports were great for companies because they could control the narrative, focusing their publications on all the things they were doing to develop a more diverse organization, and only releasing the data that they wanted to for the story they hoped to tell. The UK Gender Pay Gap reporting requirements mean that companies lose some ability to control the narrative. Having to publish metrics on diversity helps everyone to better understand where companies are and how they are progressing (or regressing) in their attempts to increase diversity and inclusion. If all the diversity and inclusion programs highlighted in company diversity reports are not improving the data, then they are clearly not the (only) solution. Looking at the data companies have been compelled to release rather than just what they wanted to release ‚Äî specifically 2017 to 2018 UK gender pay gap data ‚Äî reveals that year over year there was little progress in closing the gender pay gap across organizations (all industries), and that any progress is incremental at best. In an article in HR Magazine on the UK gender pay gap data, Rachel Sharp wrote, ‚ÄúNearly four-fifths (78%) of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, an exact repeat of the 2017 figure reported last year. At almost half (45%) of organisations the gender pay gap actually widened further in favour of men.‚Äù Within tech, many companies say this is less about pay discrimination than it is about uneven representation ‚Äî the people in the roles that pay the most, such as Engineering and Senior Management, lack diversity. So, if the gap is more a reflection of representation than pay discrepancies for the same work, the question then is, ‚ÄúHow can we increase representation?‚Äù Atlassian, one of the more active and vocal tech companies in support of diversity and inclusion, recently published a commissioned Report on the State of Diversity and Inclusion in U.S. Tech that found, ‚ÄúDespite massive amounts of attention and discussion about diversity and inclusion, the tech industry is still not making progress. The question is, why?‚Äù As highlighted in the report, and in other writings, there are many reasons why the diversity and inclusion numbers are plateauing for most companies. Some of the challenges in improving diversity and inclusion stem from more systemic undervaluing of the realities of people who fall outside of what Caroline Criado Perez describes, in her excellent book, Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias In A World Designed For Men, as the ‚Äúdefault male‚Äù. These realities include bias in urban transportation planning, failure to recognize and appreciate unpaid work, norms around appropriate works hours, the myth of meritocracy in the face of (un)conscious bias, and on. Others are more specific to tech where the default is not just male, but also tends to be young, technical, geeky, and contrarian. Some companies, however, have gone beyond valuing diversity and inclusion, viewing it as a nice thing to have, to treating it as a strategic imperative. Companies like Lever, Indiegogo, and Clover Health built diversity and inclusion into their company DNA and are leading the charge within tech companies. While these companies and ones like them are doing a lot of things right, in looking at their websites I couldn‚Äôt help but notice both how they are presenting themselves and the roles they are hiring for. They are not just looking for diverse candidates, they are creating diverse roles. These roles are distinct from most tech companies and anchored off of inclusivity, collaboration, and empathy. As of writing Indiegogo, for example, has a Trust & User Operations Associate opening and they are looking for people described as, ‚Äúpassionate about helping people and problem solving. You are empathetic yet efficient, articulate, patient, and creative‚Äù. They are a tech company seeking people who are passionate about helping people, empathetic, and patient. Further, looking at their career page they describe themselves as ‚ÄúEmpowerment, Inc.‚Äù On their career page Clover Health practically shouts, ‚ÄúClover is hiring people who care.‚Äù They reiterate this in specific job postings and most begin with some version of, ‚ÄúWe value diversity ‚Äî in backgrounds and in experiences. Healthcare is a universal concern, and we need people with different backgrounds and experiences to help us build the future.‚Äù As noted in their Diversity & Inclusion at Clover Health: 2018 Update: ‚ÄúMany companies talk about the business benefits of diversity: different perspectives coming together to create better products and results for their customers. Here at Clover, this can literally be a matter of life and death. Healthcare touches everyone, so we need employees with different work experiences, backgrounds, and points of view to effectively solve the complex problems faced in Medicare.‚Äù These ideals are present even in areas of the company, such as IT, where one might expect diversity to be slightly less critical to the business. As an example, Clover‚Äôs IT group is (as of writing) is hiring for a Data Steward, which is a role focused on collaboration between business and IT and where facilitation and customer service are highlighted as reasons why someone might love the job. Perhaps more interestingly, the ‚Äúget in touch if‚Äù skills begin with a focus on health and managed care before shifting to the more ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô aspects of the job, such as ‚Äústrong knowledge and experience with relational and dimensional databases‚Äù. In addition to being ‚Äúproduct focused‚Äù and willing to ‚Äúembrace difficult problems‚Äù, which are both fairly standard ideas within tech companies, Lever notes, ‚ÄúWe care about cross-functional empathy (XFE!). We think the best companies are built when different teams have a shared understanding of each others goals and values.‚Äù The roles they are hiring for include Customer Success Managers and a Manager of Customer Success, both part of the Customer Advocacy team described as at, ‚Äúthe intersection between our products and our customers ‚Äî we‚Äôre the advocates that help inform product decisions based on customer feedback‚Äù. Looking at the roles within most tech companies, however, and in job listings more broadly, little of this role diversity is present. A recent report from Glassdoor on the roles within tech inadvertently highlights the general lack of diversity in tech roles: When we think of employees at tech companies, what usually comes to mind are software engineers and data scientists ‚Äî people with technical skills such as coding and machine learning. But, tech companies aren‚Äôt solely hiring for tech roles. They are hiring non-tech workers as well. In today‚Äôs job market, you no longer have to be a tech worker to work in tech. While this may sound promising, the non-technical Job Titles reveal that this is less an evolution in tech than a simple reflection that tech companies are not just tech, but also companies. As such, they have Sales, Marketing, and Operations personnel as well. Moreover, the listing of tech roles reaffirms that the focus for most companies is on the tech, not how the tech empowers (or not) humans. While this does make sense ‚Äî we are talking about tech companies ‚Äî as Lever, Indiegogo, and others have shown, tech companies are doing more than building and selling products. They transforming how humans interact with the world and with each other. The roles required to ensure that this transformation enhances human experience extend well beyond engineering, sales, and marketing. So, perhaps it is time for tech companies more generally to reconsider the roles that exist within their organizations. Role diversification is one of the clearest indicators that a company more than values diversity and inclusion, but actually sees it as a strategic priority. It is also a clear indication that a company is doing more than just selling products to users, but actually empowering humans in diverse and inclusive ways. This change would probably be good for increasing diversity and inclusion at tech companies. It would also probably be good for us humans more broadly. -- -- Empowering humans to better use data and avoid being used by it. Hence Co-Founder. Angel investor. Palantir Alum. Dad. .

Let‚Äôs see with an example what I mean. Whenever I type dev and hit enter it‚Äôll run this command. This becomes very useful when navigating to different folders. We can run almost all the commands in the alias. Here is the list of some of my most-used commands: So, using these aliases, I save a lot of time during the day, to up a directory I type, instead of cd‚Ä¶ I think the rest of them are self-explanatory. We can also use arguments with $1, $2, etc. for more extendability, like in this example: Now, all I have to type is gc ‚ÄúCommit message‚Äù and it‚Äôll commit my changes with the provided message. All you have to do is find your most-used commands and try to make them shorter using an alias to make yourself more productive. Now that we know what the aliases can do, let us see how we can set them. There are two ways in which we can achieve this, the first is temporary and can be set by running the command: This will work until the session is closed. The other way is to set these aliases permanently. For that, we need to set it up in our shell, I use Zsh, so I‚Äôll be updating my ~/.zshrc file. If you are using Bash, use the ~/.bashrc file. Add the commands to the file and your file should look like this: After making changes to this file, you need to run the command: Then, all your aliases will be available for your use. This command is available on Mac and if you want to use it on Linux distributions, you can follow this guide. pbcopy is copy on steroids. You can use this command to copy the contents of a file to the clipboard. Let me give you an example. Suppose you have to copy your SSH identity to the clipboard, you can do it with this command: You can save your other passwords in different files and make use of this while logging in. Suppose you are using and accessing a remote server, and you have to provide the password, instead of opening the file, you can just pbcopy it to your clipboard and without all the hassle of opening and closing files, you‚Äôll have the passwords. It becomes more useful when it is piped with other commands like grep. It‚Äôll copy the grepped results to the clipboard. Let‚Äôs see with an example: I use this command when I am debugging the log files, and I provide a keyword to be searched for, like a timestamp, and all the lines are copied onto my clipboard. I can paste it in a file to see the required logs instead of the whole file. It can be even more useful if you use the tee command as a pipe to grep, it‚Äôll write the results to a file. It has the following syntax: Reverse search is one of the coolest things available on the Unix system. Suppose you forget the full command and you only remember some parts, what you can do is you can go to the reverse search and type the words that you remember. Let‚Äôs see it with an example. I have to restart my server running in the staging environment, I only remember the staging keyword and forgot the rest of the command. So, I type ctrl + rto go into reverse-search mode and type: It‚Äôll remember the commands previously entered and finds the right match that you are looking for. It prints the current month on the terminal. It has many different options available, which can be checked using man cal. You can encrypt a file using vim, just type :X. It‚Äôll ask you to set a password which will look like this: When you access this file again, it‚Äôll ask you for the password. If you want to learn more about vim, here is a great article: medium.com If you want to learn more about terminal shortcuts, here is a great link: medium.com We can use these commands to make our day more productive and stay on top of things. -- -- 12 Advice for programmers.

O ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù ou ‚Äútake out‚Äù √© uma lanchonete que tem uma variedade inimagin√°vel de comidas por um pre√ßo MUITO baixo. Pizzas, hamb√∫rgueres, lasanha, macarr√£o, kebabs, batata‚Ä¶Acho que j√° deu de comidas n√©, no post do Eurodicas tem mais sobre, caso voc√™ ainda tenha interesse. O povo: o irland√™s √© uma criatura que deveria ser estudada. S√£o extremamente amig√°veis, sol√≠citos e AMAM falar. Voc√™ vai estar andando na rua e as pessoas v√£o te cumprimentar, voc√™ pode ir pra um pub sozinho(a) e vai sem d√∫vida ser abordado por um senhorzinho, ou uma senhorinha perguntando de onde voc√™ √© e contar que o sobrinho-neto da irm√£ do cunhado √© casado com um(a) brasileiro(a) e perguntar se voc√™ n√£o conhece. Muita gente vai perguntar se voc√™ √© do Rio ou de S√£o Paulo, porque n√£o h√° possibilidade de voc√™ ser de alguma outra parte da floresta que rodeia esses dois estados (sim eu ouvi que al√©m de S√£o Paulo e Rio s√≥ tem floresta). O Irland√™s reclama.de.absolutamente.tudo! Eu achava que o brasileiro reclamava, mas o irland√™s venceu. Reclama do clima frio, do clima quente, do clima seco, da chuva, de tudo! Mas existe algo que eles nunca v√£o fazer √© dizer que n√£o gostaram de algo diretamente. O cara vai no barbeiro, corta o cabelo, o corte fica uma porcaria, ele odeia! O barbeiro pergunta: ‚Äúis that ok?‚Äù O irland√™s vai responder ‚Äúyeah, it‚Äôs grand!‚Äù. Se voc√™ oferecer algo pra um irland√™s e ele dizer ‚Äúgrand‚Äù ele detestou! E adivinha!? Ele vai reclamar depois pra algu√©m. Mas em geral √© um povo muito am√°vel e foi o que fez minha mudan√ßa ser mais leve, me senti muito acolhida aqui. O ambiente de trabalho aqui √© bem diferente do que vemos no Brasil, em geral. As pessoas realmente tem vida fora do trabalho e valorizam isso. Voc√™ raramente vai ver algu√©m deixando de ficar com os filhos porque tem aquela tarefa que n√£o foi terminada na sexta as 5 da tarde. A pessoa vai pra casa, aproveita o fim de semana, volta na segunda-feira e retoma o que estava fazendo, nada de hora extra (a menos que seja extremamente necess√°rio e urgente). Dentro do meu time temos pessoas de 5 pa√≠ses diferentes, ent√£o d√° pra imaginar que incr√≠vel √© trabalhar com tanta diversidade cultural a sua volta. Voc√™ vai aprender sobre coisas inusitadas de cada cultura e se impressionar com as diferen√ßas. Mercado de trabalho: sempre me perguntam como √© o mercado de trabalho aqui, eu honestamente acho que √© bem aquecido (falando sobre o mercado de tecnologia), sempre recebo in√∫meros contatos de recrutadores com vagas e acredito que se voc√™ for bem ativo com suas redes (LinkedIn, Github, etc) voc√™ consegue uma oportunidade por aqui. Athlone √© uma cidade fofa, bem no cora√ß√£o da Irlanda. √â bem pequena, aconchegante, todo mundo se conhece (mais ou menos). Tem poucas empresas de tecnologia ent√£o as oportunidades s√£o muito menores que em Dublin por exemplo. √â muito bem servida de supermercados, cinema, shoppings e √© claro pubs! O Sean's bar, o pub mais antigo da Irlanda √© aqui e atrai v√°rios e v√°rios turistas pra cidade. Athlone tamb√©m √© um destino muito visado para comemora√ß√£o de despedidas de solteiras(os), todos os finais de semana voc√™ v√™ grupos e mais grupos de amigas vindo para os bares e baladas juntas pra se acabar de beber. Pra finalizar, abertamente falando sobre sentimentos, eu nunca imaginei que eu fosse t√£o ligada ao Brasil (emocionalmente). Eu sinto falta da comida, de falar portugu√™s, de ver minha fam√≠lia e meus amigos, ao mesmo tempo que sinto que aqui √© minha casa. Experimentei alguns altos e baixos, de ir dormir algumas vezes chorando e a √∫nica coisa que me consolava era pensar no qu√£o privilegiada eu sou de ter a oportunidade de estar aqui, com um excelente emprego. Minha qualidade de vida melhorou consideravelmente, meu n√≠vel de estresse √© praticamente nulo. Ir numa lojinha e comprar p√£o de queijo, tomar um guaran√°. Comprar pa√ßoca e fazer todo mundo do trabalho comer (e adorar). S√£o pequenos prazeres que morando longe voc√™ aprende a valorizar. Volto em breve com posts mais informativos que esse, s√≥ achei que seria legal compartilhar um pouquinho. Beijocas!

This solution relies on the distribution of Trustchain responsibility to several types of nodes that are run by network users. Nodes are needed to verify transactions and to ensure that the COTI network remains safeguarded against potential fraud and cyber manipulation, such as double spending attempts, penny spend attacks, sybil attacks and more. There are four types of nodes in the COTI network, including Full Nodes, DSP Nodes, Trust Score Nodes, and History Nodes. The most common node type is a Full Node. We expect the number of Full Nodes to be in the hundreds, or potentially thousands at network maturity, while a reasonable number of DSP Nodes will be in the dozens and a lesser amount for Trust Score Nodes. In the current development stage, Full Nodes are the only available nodes that can be run by network users. DSP Nodes and Trust Score Nodes will also be operated by users as the network matures. Full Nodes are the main client-facing servers of the system. Each transaction sent from a wallet is received by a Full Node and propagated to the entire system. Full Nodes perform Trustchain Consensus by receiving new transactions from wallets, validating them, doing Proof of Trust and attaching them to the DAG. Full Nodes also execute COTI smart contracts in a decentralized manner. On the COTI network, Full Nodes can define their own price list for users and compete for them. Consequently, COTI Full Nodes are responsible for collecting fees on all protocol usage and transferring the network fee to the network pool. Watch this short video to find out more. ‚úì Simple, inexpensive and easy to run Full Nodes‚úì All node operators can earn profits from running nodes‚úì Node operator Trust Scores increase in line with the amount of work performed for the COTI network‚úì Merchants can run nodes and set their fees to zero to attract more customers When running nodes, operators provide the network with useful resources, including CPU, memory, storage and network bandwidth. These resources are not cost-free, which is why node operators are compensated and have the opportunity to earn a reasonable ROI. Full Node operators receive fees collected from transactions. The more transactions that a Full Node processes, the more it earns. COTI‚Äôs staking model is built to be competitive to decentralized finance (DeFi) income models and provides a means to generate a steady income from the process of transaction approval on the COTI network. The economic model of COTI nodes is designed to be fair, efficient and flexible and is based on finely tuned fee distribution mechanisms and staking requirements. As real world transactions are usually denoted in fiat currencies and node operator fees are a percentage of these transactions, a natural hedge for the COTI coin price is created. This is a major advantage over other staking models and currencies. All nodes are required to deposit (stake) COTI native coins to participate in the network, although the requirements are different for various node types. DSP Nodes and Trust Score Nodes, which are more substantial components of the network foundation, require higher staking than Full Nodes. In the COTI network, transactions are created according to several patterns defined by the transaction type. The most common types are payment for goods or services, remittance payments and singular transfers. In the first two cases, a transaction originator creates a payment request, and the transaction is created according to it. The transaction originator must input the Full Node address in the payment request in order to pre-select the node (a Full Node is selected by users for singular transfers). COTI provides an automated tool for Full Node selection, enabling a merchant, or any other transaction originator, to choose nodes according to the specified criteria. Merchants also have the ability to run Full Nodes themselves Full Node operators set fees autonomously, which makes setting competitive fee structures important. If a user knows a Full Node with a better price list, it can be re-selected when sending transactions. Important note: server throughput is limited, so large merchants can work with a pool of Full Nodes which are chosen at random at the time of transaction. As a rule, Full Node fees are collected in the same token as the main payment. Full Nodes are free to define which tokens they process and accept for fees and those they do not. Full Nodes can swap tokens they have received in various ways: For standard payment tokens, the network fee is calculated from the transaction flow and debited from the merchant‚Äôs virtual account in the network fee pool. The merchant is required to deposit the estimated amount of COTI native coins into the pool, or alternatively to cover the deficit at the end of the day. For singular transfers, all fees are payable in COTI native coins. All information presented below describes the basic model of Full Node staking. Future models will cover DSP and Trust Score Node models, as well as their delegated staking models. As described, Full Node operators gain fees by approving merchant transactions. Merchants select the nodes they wish to work with according to the node‚Äôs trust score, which is determined by its level of service quality and fees. Node operators can set fees as they see fit, with the understanding that other node operators may set lower and more competitive fees. The following model assumes 0.05% as a fee, although a node operator can set higher or lower fees. The COTI network processes merchant transactions in an ever growing volume every month, which increases the potential for nodes to turn a profit. In August 2019, the COTI network processed transactions equating to 225M COTI (an equivalent of about $5M USD). Assuming a 0.05% processing fee set by a Full Node, the potential income from transaction processing in August 2019 would have been 112.5K COTI. As COTI‚Äôs staking model is aimed to compete with DeFi models, we are aiming for the network to offer approximately 30% in annualized returns on staking. This means that in August 2019, Full Node monthly staking would have been 4.5M COTI for all nodes combined. Profits may increase as more merchants join the network and monthly turnover grows. Higher profits can also be registered by setting higher processing fees for a better quality of service (e.g., better uptime). New node operators joining the network will foster increased competition, which will lower returns, although we expect this dynamic to balance itself out under free market conditions. To encourage node operators while ensuring a healthy network environment and staking allocations, we are offering two incentive programs for running Full Nodes: As of October 2019, when the first Full Nodes will be operated in a decentralized nature, the staking requirements will be as follows: *Staking requirements may change over time** COTI ambassadors may run up to three Advanced Full Nodes In COTI, node staking amounts must be sent to the node‚Äôs special address which is maintained by DSP Node consensus at the network‚Äôs maturity stage. As a temporary solution for the network‚Äôs infancy stage, stakes are deposited to a node‚Äôs special address belonging to the COTI financial server, which is responsible for disputes, processing network fees, rolling reserves and more. The operation flow for this address is pre-defined, so staked capital cannot be seized from the node under any circumstances. Full Nodes have the opportunity to earn fees from merchants, as well as P2P transactions. Use our calculator below to estimate your potential earnings as a node operator in the COTI network. Profits are relative to your level of service and fees you‚Äôve set. The following tables illustrate various scenarios for network transaction volume, number of nodes, fees and staking requirements. Trusted users with high Trust Scores can become node operators after submitting satisfactory KYC documentation. At COTI, we‚Äôve made running nodes as easy as possible ‚Äî all you need is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) that meets the minimum requirements outlined below. You can read our technical guide on running a COTI Full Node here. The requirements for running a Full Node are as follows: ‚úì 16GB of memory ‚úì 4 vCPU cores‚úì Bandwidth (up to 3.5 Gbps)‚úì Broadband Internet connection‚úì 24/7 availability‚úì Operating system: Ubuntu/Linux/Windows The estimated costs for running such a VPS on Digital Ocean or Vultr is approximately $40-$80 per month. Users can operate the following nodes in the COTI network in the near future: Double Spend Prevention (DSP) NodesA set of highly trusted distributed servers responsible for DSP consensus, account balance control and general protocol and data integrity. Each transaction must be approved and signed by the majority of the DSP nodes, and users cannot directly connect to DSP Nodes. To run a DSP Node, a user is required to stake a substantial amount of COTI. This amount can be deposited solely by the DSP Node operator, or by a group of network participants delegating their deposits to the node operator. Trust Score Nodes Trust Score nodes are dedicated servers responsible for calculating and storing participant Trust Scores and KYC statuses. To run a Trust Score Node, a user is required to stake a substantial amount of COTI. Running a COTI Full Node enables operators to collect fees from each transaction. To be eligible to run a Full Node, operators must stake 100,000 COTI for each node and set the fee they wish to charge per transaction. An operator may also choose to stake 250,000 COTI to run an Advanced Node and guarantee a 25% annualized return. COTI has been built to be a free marketplace and operators may compete based on their service level and fee structure. In August 2019, node operators processed more than $5M in transactions in the COTI network. We expect turnover to continue increasing monthly and encourage users to run full nodes on the COTI network. We invite you to register to become a COTI Full Node operator today.

This was our first community which brought us press and a first investor. I had the pleasure to interview Thomas Querton, founder of atlasGO Thank you so much for joining us! What‚Äôs your startup origin story? How did you break into the space? Starting a company at 18, meeting Pr. Muhammad Yunus & running the 20Km of Brussels were some of the ingredients to kick atlasGO off. I started my first company during my studies in Brussels. With 2 friends we were bored in class and wanted to practice what we were learning in our economic books. We started a textile company that we never really had the ambitions to scale after our studies were over. Losing my entrepreneurial virginity at a young age was helpful to demystify the experience of starting a company. It is when I heard Pr. Muhammad Yunus talk in Brussels that I understood that I wanted to bring together my entrepreneurial ambitions with impactful goals. I had always been involved within my community by traveling with disabled youth or raising funds for underprivileged students but never thought that I could make it a career. Pr. Muhammad Yunus made me understand that not only could I make it my life‚Äôs work but that thousands of social entrepreneurs were also doing it! I was on. All I needed was a big idea. A couple of Months later my girlfriend at the time challenged me to run the 20Km of Brussels. I had never run a race before but I wanted to prove to her that I could do it. I hated the running but loved the community. I felt part of my own community for the first time in my life. The hugs, the cheers, the camaraderie. Everyone was raising funds for a cause they cared about and everything was beautiful. I was definitely high on people. When I was cooling off I wondered if we could create a platform for people to be part of such a community every day. A global community of sweaty change-makers! That was the first spark of atlasGO. What has been your toughest challenge as a startup founder and how did you overcome it? The toughest challenge was to be alone. You can‚Äôt do anything by yourself. I flew to San Francisco in 2015 with Steve Jobs‚Äô biography under my arm. I was as ambitious as I was naive. I didn‚Äôt know much about anything. I still don‚Äôt. But at least now I have a team! Meeting Magali and Olivier during my studies in San Francisco was the most important part of transforming the spark into an impactful fire. What has been your most notable accomplishment for your startup to date? Was there a particular thing that you attribute that success to? Resilience. Everybody has good ideas. Very few people follow through with them. Our proudest accomplishment is the community that we built. Together we have raised more than $450k for non-profits around the world by creating partnerships with some of the largest companies in the world. I am also very proud of the talent that has joined our team to make our vision a reality. With their hard work and creative ideas, we now offer products that help non-profits raise funding and engage their community as well as products that help companies engage their workforce around the causes they support.

In every direction you look, the land runs underneath your gaze. It may be bare in places, there may be trees, roads, buildings, terracing, walls, farms, hotels, beaches ‚Äî but, at some point, everything falls away and ends at the sea. If the island is small enough, you will be able to see its limits in every direction you turn. Your separation is unavoidable: the word ‚Äúinsular‚Äù derives from insula, the Latin word for island. Still, if you are lucky, other forms are visible in the distance. No need to despair then: close by, you have neighbours, new people to meet, other lands to explore. As solitary as you might feel standing on these heights, there is the comfort that your island is part of something bigger: an archipelago. There is no way to understand Kyriaki Goni‚Äôs work without the concept of the archipelago. More than a cluster of islands, it is a community ‚Äî a carefully balanced collection of individualities that each retain their sense of separation and independence. A confederation of singularities. The clear inspiration for Kyriaki, in this regard, are Greece‚Äôs approximately 6,000 islands. Indeed, for the seafaring ancient Greeks, the water separating their islands was neither empty space nor a barrier, but an interconnected web of swift roads and fertile feeding grounds. There is no way to understand Kyriaki Goni‚Äôs work without the concept of the archipelago. More than a cluster of islands, it is a community ‚Äî a carefully balanced collection of individualities that each retain their sense of separation and independence. A confederation of singularities. Kyriaki tells me she spent every summer (‚Äúbeginning at age 0‚Äù) traveling across the Aegean archipelago. As a multi-disciplinary artist who focuses on the relationship between humanity and technology, for Kyriaki, the idea of the archipelago has a contemporary analog: the network. While popular techno-discourse pushes us to feel ever-more connected (to make more and more ‚Äúfriends‚Äù), Kyriaki‚Äôs vision of a network aims to retain the individual within the larger group. Even her most up-to-date work flows back and forth through time: an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) overlaid with the ancient geological structures of the Aegean islands; a 19th-century astronomer converses with a machine learning algorithm. As a multi-disciplinary artist who focuses on the relationship between humanity and technology, for Kyriaki, the idea of the archipelago has a contemporary analog: the network. But before ranging too far afield, let‚Äôs begin with the single point at the center of this particular assemblage: Kyriaki herself. Born in Athens, Kyriaki was educated at the city‚Äôs German school (to the extent that she calls German a ‚Äúsecond mother tongue‚Äù). Trained first in anthropology, in Greece and then the Netherlands, she eventually returned to settle in Greece. Kyriaki, though influenced by her research-based training, is definitively an artist. She tells me, ‚ÄúThe starting point of my works are very emotional. It‚Äôs not a research curiosity that drives me but an ‚Äòemotional trigger.‚Äô My topics are ones that I‚Äôm moved by as a person, as a human being, living right now; not as a ‚Äòresearcher.‚Äô For example, my recent works have focused on observing technology and how it‚Äôs connected to society. I want to understand how these processes affect me, and then how they are shaping the way we all live, perceive, and express our emotions.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe starting point of my works are very emotional. It‚Äôs not a research curiosity that drives me but an ‚Äòemotional trigger.‚Äô My topics are ones that I‚Äôm moved by as a person, as a human being, living right now; not as a ‚Äòresearcher.‚Äô ‚Äú But, I ask her, with the growing popularity of research-based artistic practice, she must draw on her anthropological studies to some degree? She resists: ‚ÄúMy creative process is never strictly linear. Throughout my preparation, I feel myself falling into a black hole: I become overinformed, I‚Äôm in chaos. Eventually, this becomes a period of digestion; eventually, something starts to take shape. It‚Äôs not a predictable process, but neither is it driven by luck. Inevitably, my feelings, my observations, and yes, my research, start to form structures which organize my thinking. Still, I am uneasy when people present their artistic process as overly ‚Äòresearch-oriented.‚Äô Methodologies and rigor are fine but we shouldn‚Äôt, as artists, lose our freedom. Creativity and openness are the most important traits we have.‚Äù To drive home her point, she draws one more contrast: ‚ÄúI feel certain that the artistic process cannot be quantified. Yes, there are specific times of day when I‚Äôm ‚Äòworking‚Äô ‚Äî that is, consciously thinking and gathering material. But I don‚Äôt have an 8-hour schedule; it never stops. Ideas and solutions pop up throughout the day (and the night!), especially when I‚Äôm not in the studio. I believe you must put your brain, your body, and your soul into the artistic process ‚Äî you must expose yourself fully to the questions you‚Äôre having. There is never truly a pause; a part of my mind is always dedicated to these questions.‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel certain that the artistic process cannot be quantified. Yes, there are specific times of day when I‚Äôm ‚Äòworking‚Äô ‚Äî that is, consciously thinking and gathering material. But I don‚Äôt have an 8-hour schedule; it never stops. Ideas and solutions pop up throughout the day (and the night!), especially when I‚Äôm not in the studio. I believe you must put your brain, your body, and your soul into the artistic process ‚Äî you must expose yourself fully to the questions you‚Äôre having. There is never truly a pause; a part of my mind is always dedicated to these questions.‚Äù Going beyond Kyriaki‚Äôs internal processes, we discuss how these complex tangles of emotions and research find concrete expression. Take a recent project, Networks of Trust, motivated by an opposition to how world‚Äôs largest corporations (Facebook, Google, et. al) are profiting from our memories and feelings. To explore this vast subject, Kyriaki produced a multi-faceted work, consisting of a media installation, drawings, an audio manifesto, and a trove of digital material that can only be accessed when viewers are in proximity with one of three nodes that make up her alternative ‚Äúnetwork of trust.‚Äù Thus, like a pilgrim from days gone by, Kyriaki asks us to travel to one of the trio of nodes (on Tilos; in her studio in Athens; and a nomadic one which pops up wherever the project is exhibited) to experience the work. Through her demand, the universal ease and convenience promised by today‚Äôs start-up culture is confronted with an old-fashioned idea of locality, the topos. Such a sense of place is essential for Kyriaki, since from this groundedness, she can emphasize the idea of collectivity. She says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for me to cultivate a collective narration at the bridge between ancient oral traditions and contemporary internet culture. For example, in another project, Aegean Datahavens, I imagine places where our data could be stored and protected, not exploited. These havens would be powered by the sun and cooled by the Mediterranean water. They would be owned through a cooperation of the islands that housed them. They would mirror the way in which memory has always been preserved amongst islanders, as a shared effort.‚Äù Across her works, elegant syntheses of disparate artistic materials help her imagine futuristic possibilities built on past relationships ‚Äî a return to old ways, but with a difference. Indeed, Networks of Trust, Aegean Datahavens, or any of her projects really, are telling of the way that Kyriaki asks us to question our relationship to technology. She is no Luddite, she does not want to smash the machines. She expertly utilizes P2P and IPFS technologies. But she also wants us to be reminded of other ways of thinking, remembering, relating, and looking. She reveals how the newest, must-have technologies insist on making us forget that we ever lived otherwise. But she is never didactic, nor patronizing. Rather, Kyriaki‚Äôs works reveal themselves gradually; they demand time and listening. She admits, ‚ÄúThey are highly complicated. I can‚Äôt escape this. They ask for your sustained attention and engagement.‚Äù Two things that in our contemporary media environment are often in short supply ‚Äî which is exactly why such slow work is invaluable today. The subtlety of Kyriaki‚Äôs message may be difficult to grasp for overtaxed adults, but she is gratified with her work with children. In a series of workshops, with titles like, ‚ÄúDo Robots Dream, Mom? Are Robots Afraid, Dad?‚Äù, Kyriaki commits time and energy to working through these same topics with the next generation. She is consistently amazed by their flexibility and creativity. For example, a group of children asked to invent their own ‚ÄúAegean Datahavens‚Äù came up with refreshingly original solutions. Meanwhile, in another workshop focused on our relationship to technology, an unaccompanied Syrian refugee child living in Athens spoke about the importance of Messenger for keeping in touch with his distant family. Moments like these help broaden Kyriaki‚Äôs perspective. Our contemporary society has countless tech evangelists and a small but vocal chorus of critics. Rarer, though, are those who ask us to be more thoughtful with our machines while connecting their functions to ancient practices of connection and communication. Kyriaki has another motivation for running her workshops: countering the feeling that people on the periphery have of always being behind. Especially when her work began to focus on technology, she became worried herself about not having access to the latest advances and developments. Even as someone with the fortune of access to a good education, experiences abroad, and the ability to travel, she regretted her remoteness. She didn‚Äôt want young people in Greece to have the same fear. Lately, though, she has begun to see her surroundings in a more positive light. After all, it is the particularities of Greece that have informed her belief in other, older kinds of networks. And anyways, she adds, ‚ÄúPeople on the periphery are closer to each other.‚Äù She then goes on, ‚ÄúBeing on the periphery has its problems but it can also be fruitful. You have the space to take a different approach. I feel like I have an off space quality, one that allows me to draw on local and personal experiences to have a more balanced perspective. These days, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm chasing after the latest thing. Instead, by being in the periphery, I feel a desire to support other people who are with me on the edge.‚Äù ‚ÄúBeing on the periphery has its problems but it can also be fruitful.

While the periphery has often been defined from the outside as that which is behind, away from the center and its cutting-edge developments, Kyriaki points out that the edge also lies at the frontier and the avant-garde. She says, ‚ÄúWhile preparing my presentation for Transmediale on Networks of Trust, I came across something from a writer about the concept of the periphery. He said that we, on the international periphery, have the destiny to be the first to meet the future. For example, the peripheries have already been the first areas to face the effects of climate change. This is frightening but also inspiring. Who knows what will come out of the periphery next?‚Äù Visual Artist Kyriaki Goni is a 2018 SNF ARTWORKS Fellow.

Having teams that are spread out across the world can make communication, collaboration, and productivity an issue, so that‚Äôs why we have found great value in apps and software that make our lives easier. One of the toughest things we deal with is which apps to choose and which new technology will be beneficial to our company. We have to be intentional about leveraging technology to make the most of our days and weeks. Crystal Washington, a futurist, technology strategist, and author, recently spoke at the Comerica Women‚Äôs Business Symposium in Dallas and gave some incredible insight about how we should view technology. Here are three questions that she asks herself when it comes to any task in life are: Does it have to be done? Can I delegate this? And, is there an app for this? She proposed using outsourcing applications like Fiverr, Upwork, TaskRabbit and more to make your personal and business life more efficient. I think this same idea applies to the use of any tool at your company as well. There are so many tools available for every part of your business, you can get bogged down just trying to decide which ones to use. At Pinnacle we ask ourselves a few questions before implementing anything: Do we need this? Will the time it takes to implement and learn this be rewarded with better efficiency or better user experience? Will we have strong adoption from all the users and stakeholders? Washington stressed at the end of her talk the importance of keeping the human touch and I want to make that same disclaimer here. Many of the tools I‚Äôll discuss below are communication and automation tools, but still nothing replaces the value of face-to-face interaction. Don‚Äôt use text messages or other ways of communication when actually speaking to someone is better. I‚Äôm a firm believer in the importance of the in-person meeting and the handwritten note. Use technology to make your life more efficient so you can actually have more time to have these human interactions. So, here are some apps and other tech that Pinnacle teams use to be as efficient and effective as possible. I‚Äôve broken them down into some categories: Productivity, Habits, Fitness, Communication, and Entertainment (because it‚Äôs always good to have a little fun). Email is still king when it comes to business communication. We use Outlook at Pinnacle and many of our associates make great use of the shared calendar features, especially our executives. As a rapidly expanding company, you never know if our executives will be in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, or somewhere else altogether. Getting a meeting set up can be difficult, but it‚Äôs made so much easier when everyone has visibility into calendars via Outlook. And when we need host meetings with remote attendees, we use Zoom to connect. Many of our teams have use Monday to get on the same page with projects. While it doesn‚Äôt take the place of Smartsheets for our most complex projects, it‚Äôs easy to pick up and use and has some powerful features that allow excellent customization and integrations with other apps. Monday gives each team member visibility into all the different projects they are involved in. It‚Äôs also a great place to store documents related to projects with their action items and related commentary in one place. Similar to Monday, but more effective for personal tasks with excellent Outlook integration that syncs with its mobile app, Todoist is a productivity hound‚Äôs dream. It allows you to keep all of your tasks in one place and many use it for both personal and business activities, so nothing is missed in a busy day (and it also integrates with Monday.com). There is nothing more satisfying than checking off a task on a to-do list! Communication is extremely important on every team, but especially when your teams are spread out across the country and the world. Using an instant messaging service cuts down on the clunky and inefficient use of email. Sending quick messages back and forth allows constant communication and keeps everyone on the same page. It‚Äôs almost impossible to be successful without communication. Our associates make great use of the Teams app on the phone to be able to communicate no matter where they are. This is a personal favorite of mine. Many people in the United States aren‚Äôt as familiar with WhatsApp, but people around the world can‚Äôt live without it. It‚Äôs another instant messaging/texting app, but it works all over the world and has some great functionality with voice messaging and media sharing. So often our phones are the reason we aren‚Äôt productive but using apps like Productive can help change that. Instead of using your phone to mindlessly scroll through social media, you can use your phone to remind you to go for a run, meditate, walk your dog, or practice other forms of self-improvement and self-care. I‚Äôve written about the importance of taking care of yourself in the past, and it‚Äôs so necessary to treat yourself well. Using Productive can be a step in that direction as it encourages positive habits and gives you that motivation to keep your daily streaks alive. Streaks is very similar to Productive in that it is geared around helping you form good habits and get a daily streak going for each habit. So, if you‚Äôre trying to break a bad habit like smoking, or start a new one like running, using an app like Streaks can steer you in the right directions. Plus, these apps add that gamification element that spurs you on to do good things for yourself and others. Running is so much easier when you have a community. I highly recommend finding a running buddy, but figuring out scheduling with someone else can be tough. So that‚Äôs where run tracking apps with community connections are so useful. You will be more encouraged to get out and exercise when you have that push from others that you are connected to. Use your natural competitiveness and desire not to let others down motivate you to get more in shape today! There are so many fitness apps out there, so this is far from an exhaustive list of fitness trackers. So many people who love using MyFitnessPal because of its food information. So much of losing and maintaining weight is what you put into your body. Using MyFitnessPal you can search the food you eat and learn the calorie count, nutrition information, and serving size. Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to food. When you know what you are putting in your body you can make more informed decisions with your food choices. I use my Garmin Forerunner 920XT watch every time I work out. It‚Äôs my favorite piece of technology! It goes well beyond the typical heartrate, workout time, length of a run or bike ride tracking and offers VO2 max estimates, running dynamics like ground contact time, and a whole host of other stats and information that help me be a better triathlete. It‚Äôs waterproof and even tracks my swimming distance, pace, stroke count, and more. I benefit so much from this watch. Any serious triathlete should look into getting a Garmin Watch. Long plane, train, and car rides can be used as opportunities for self-development and growth or to unwind and get some much-needed relaxation. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to put some headphones in and relax with a great book (especially if you get motion sickness from reading in moving vehicles!). Audible is a great way to learn about the latest leadership trends, catch up on great recommendations from your friends, or just immerse yourself in something you‚Äôre fascinated by. With Audible you can listen in your car during your commute as well. Start by listening to the books that I suggested in these two Medium posts! Most of us love binging shows when we get the chance, but the time can be hard to find. This is a great app to use on planes ‚Äî especially long international flights. You can download shows on Netflix so you can watch them offline, which means that you don‚Äôt have to pay for the WiFi on the plane to enjoy your favorite shows and movies. I don‚Äôt suggest spending all of your free time watching Netflix, but it can be nice to just turn off from time-to-time and relax! So tell me, what are your favorite productivity apps? Which apps do you use for fitness, and what are your favorite apps to use when you just want to relax?

https://medium.com/@patently_com/5g-seps-a-nice-cup-of-tea-7d98fd296424?source=tag_archive---------117-----------------------,5G SEPs & a nice cup of T,We talk Standard Essential Patents and the most essential of all essentials: a perfectly brewed cuppa.,Andrew Samm,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Andrew Samm Follow -- Listen Share 7th September 2019 This week, we are in Brussels at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management (ULB) for the Standard Essential Patents Strategy Conference. For the uninitiated, a standard-essential patent is one that covers an invention that must be used to comply with a technical standard. A technical standard is an agreed specification of a given technology that ensures products, components and services supplied by different companies will be mutually compatible. Basically, it‚Äôs why your Samsung TV can talk to your LG Blu-ray player, and both can talk to your Bose surround sound system (other consumer electronics brands are available). Without collaboration over these technical standards, each manufacturer would have proprietary solutions and that mass of cables in your cupboard would be even bigger. One of the busiest standards-setting bodies is the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). They are the chaps responsible for developing all the mobile phones and phone networks we rely on. The hottest topic at the moment is 5G. With speeds over 100 times faster than the current network, 5G is key to other technological advances becoming a reality: autonomous vehicles for example. The data transfer rates possible with 5G mean that when sending messages to a vehicle travelling at 60 mph, the distance travelled would be approx 60cm as opposed to the 6.5m capable using 4G ‚Äî an improvement that could be the difference between life and death. Apple recently agreed to acquire Intel‚Äôs smartphone modem business together with a portfolio of Intel patents relating to wireless technology. Looking at Intel‚Äôs ETSI declarations relating to 5G standards over the last few years, we can see almost 600 live published families plus another 260+ unpublished applications filed in the period 2013‚Äì2019. No wonder Apple was interested. Even hotter than 5G would be the 100¬∞C water I am about to pour over a teabag to kick off the office afternoon ritual: cup of tea, two dark chocolate Hobnobs and The Times cryptic crossword. We‚Äôre in good company ‚Äî the Queen also takes tea every day at 4pm and, while Her Majesty is said to prefer Rich Tea biscuits, we all agree that a good cuppa mid-afternoon is the perfect way to reinvigorate body and mind ready for the final push into the evening But is there an agreed method of making a cup of tea; is there a standard? Believe it or not, yes! ISO 3103: Tea ‚Äî Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests. (In fact, there are 34 tea-related ISO standards listed in their standards catalogue.) ISO 3103 specifies, among other things, 2g of tea per 100ml of water ( ¬± 2%) and brewing time of 6 mins!? It is not meant to define the proper method for brewing tea intended for general consumption, but rather to document a tea brewing procedure where meaningful sensory comparisons can be made. An example of such a test would be a taste-test to establish which blend of teas to choose for a particular brand or basic label in order to maintain a consistent tasting brewed drink from harvest to harvest. An agreed standard for how to make a ‚Äòproper‚Äô cup of tea is much harder to come by. Many have tried, below are some of our favourites: George Orwell ‚Äîin 1946 he penned an essay titled ‚ÄúA nice cup of tea‚Äù which has 11 rules, including rule 10. ‚Äúone should pour tea into the cup first. This is one of the most controversial points of all; indeed in every family in Britain, there are probably two schools of thought on the subject. The milk-first school can bring forward some fairly strong arguments, but I maintain that my own argument is unanswerable. This is that, by putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is liable to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round.‚Äù The late, great Christopher Hitchens agrees with many of Orwell‚Äôs rules and has several of his own, mainly centred around the recommendation to avoid tea altogether when in the USA. ‚ÄúIt is already virtually impossible in the United States, unless you undertake the job yourself, to get a cup or pot of tea that tastes remotely as it ought to. It‚Äôs quite common to be served a cup or a pot of water, well off the boil, with the tea bags lying on an adjacent cold plate. Then comes the ridiculous business of pouring the tepid water, dunking the bag until some change in colour occurs, and eventually finding some way of disposing of the resulting and dispiriting tampon surrogate. The drink itself is then best thrown away, though if swallowed, it will have about the same effect on morale as a reading of the memoirs of President James Earl Carter.‚Äù One person Hitch didn‚Äôt agree with is Yoko Ono. In his article in SLATE in 2011 titled: ‚ÄúHow to make a decent cup of tea‚Äù he scolds Yoko and John Lennon for the practice of putting the water in the cup before the teabag (I can imagine a Hell, John, and that‚Äôs how they make tea there!)

https://medium.com/@UberATG/becoming-a-mission-specialist-piloting-the-development-of-safe-self-driving-technology-bd0d4439a50a?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,Becoming a Mission Specialist: Piloting the Development of Safe Self-Driving Technology,"By: Nick Wedge, Learning and Development at Uber ATG",UberATG,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in UberATG Follow -- 2 Listen Share Developing a self-driving vehicle is challenging, dynamic, and captivating, as there are changes and advances almost on a daily basis. Take a moment to consider what it‚Äôs like to be responsible for safely monitoring our developmental technology in the real world from behind the wheel. At Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), that is the primary function of the Mission Specialist. As the pilots (driver‚Äôs seat) and co-pilots (passenger‚Äôs seat) of our developmental self-driving vehicles, they are just a handful of people who will experience the development of automated vehicle (AV) technology unlike anyone else in the world. The job requires them to continuously scan the operating environment, compare the vehicle‚Äôs behavior with their mental model of appropriate vehicle behavior, and correct any undesired behavior. Here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs only going to get more challenging as the technology improves and capabilities expand ‚Äî undesired behaviors become more subtle and infrequent requiring more vigilance. At Uber ATG we have the responsibility of maintaining (human) learning systems that can match a rapid development cadence ‚Äî to ensure that testing of AV technology in the real world is done safely and effectively. That‚Äôs the role of the Learning and Development Team. First, some context Having recently released our Safety Case Framework, you can see where our Mission Specialist education efforts fit (G1.3.1) in supporting our claim that our self-driving vehicles are acceptably safe to operate on public roads. Not only is Mission Specialist training a part of our safety case for testing activities with a Mission Specialist, but the team responsible for developing the curriculum is a part of the 40+ person multi-disciplinary Safety Team at Uber ATG, giving us the opportunity to represent operational needs and perspective to the entire organization. While the scope of the Learning and Development Team has evolved over the years to meet the unique needs of those piloting and co-piloting our self-driving vehicles, the team continues to support all test operations, both at the track and on the road. The responsibilities of a Mission Specialist are safety-critical and we have designed our training programs to reflect that. Before they join the team, Mission Specialists go through a screening process to ensure they have a current driver's license and clean record. Then they must be internally certified to safely and effectively supervise a self-driving vehicle through an in-depth training regime. These trainings are designed to ensure that the Mission Specialist has the information, knowledge and support that they need to succeed in their role. Throughout a Mission Specialist‚Äôs career, they will be expected to maintain this internal certification to carry out their responsibilities, which requires continuous education and yearly recertifications. Below are some key focus areas of our programs that help Mission Specialists receive and maintain their certifications. Understanding the Mission Before Mission Specialists get behind the wheel of an Uber developmental self-driving vehicle, they spend their first week learning about the organization and how the work they do supports our mission to bring safe, reliable self-driving transportation to the world. We believe that, as educators, we are responsible for our learners‚Äô understanding of the impact their work has on the company‚Äôs success. It‚Äôs also easier to train learners who find meaning and take pride in their work. Becoming A Best-in-Class Driver Not everyone personally drives a Volvo XC90 Sport Utility Vehicle ‚Äî the base vehicle we currently use to test our self-driving system. It stands to reason then that it‚Äôs important to familiarize our Mission Specialists with our modified development vehicle on its own, without self-driving capabilities enabled. Mission Specialists spend time getting certified solely to operate our self-driving cars manually. This gives us the opportunity to focus on subjects such as: Anyone piloting or co-piloting the vehicle while in self-driving will have to complete this certification, which means passing a series of in-classroom and in-vehicle assessments. Understanding the AV System Aside from familiarity with the vehicle itself, we spend a considerable amount of time educating Mission Specialists about how and why the vehicle is making the decisions it is. By taking Mission Specialists through the detailed data flows from the sensors of the vehicle to the controls that execute a trajectory or behavior, we create a more prepared pilot and co-pilot. Mission Specialists gain a strong practical understanding of the complete development program and process that Uber ATG undertakes giving them an advanced understanding of self-driving technology. All of the topics that are introduced in-classroom are also reinforced in-vehicle, giving us the opportunity to take a learned concept and put it into action on the track. This helps ensure that our Mission Specialists can anticipate vehicle behavior and maintain safe operations from both positions; the pilot through manual controls, and co-pilot through system oversight. Training Through Faults At Uber ATG, Mission Specialists are systematically exposed to random faults injected by the vehicle‚Äôs self-driving system (such as a sudden lane departure), and environmental factors (such as unexpected road users entering the roadway). They are tested on their ability to respond to the worst possible situations. This type of training helps ensure that they have the appropriate reaction time and execute the appropriate correction maneuver. Mission Specialists are first introduced to Basic Fault Injection Tests, which include very simple faults at low speed without outside actors or environmental factors. These injections occur during straight-line driving and are designed to introduce the learner to vehicle behaviors during a fault, such as lane drifting. Basic fault injection is a stepping stone to more complex Scenario Fault Injection Tests that represent possible situations seen out in the real world. The situations tested with a Scenario fault injection add the complexity of different road infrastructure, such as intersections, and actors, such as pedestrians and cyclists simulated using robots. Staying Relevant and Effective The Learning and Development team participates actively in the software development process. This means our team has a process for anticipating and managing change from software, operational policy, or operational design domain, which captures the specific conditions under which our self-driving system will operate, including where and when. When the development process, autonomy (or human) performance, a safety concern, or another avenue indicates that amendments to our training program are required, the team ensures new hire programs stay relevant. This updated training extends to current Mission Specialists by way of in-vehicle, in-classroom, computer-based training, or in a simple pre-shift brief. What‚Äôs more, all of our training content is reviewed twice a year by the Learning and Development team, internal subject matter experts, and members of the broader Safety Team. These results are collected, analyzed, presented to the organization as evidence of our programs‚Äô effectiveness, and serve as a rationale for the changes we make to our curricula. Maintaining Certifications Aside from having to pass a number of in-classroom and in-vehicle assessments, Mission Specialists participate in two key programs to maintain their certifications: Recertification and Refresh training. Recertification Training measures Mission Specialist performance on a yearly basis and ensures continued, high-performance piloting and co-piloting skills. Regardless of a Mission Specialist‚Äôs performance or time in role, they are expected to complete Uber ATG‚Äôs Autonomy Recertification program. This program provides an opportunity for Mission Specialists to relearn skills that are rarely used in practice, such as fault injection and emergency maneuver exercises. Refresh Training is conducted in response to time out of vehicle, a minor infraction/breach of policy, or when we identify other training opportunities that can improve Mission Specialist performance. Refresh opportunities ensure that, with the right performance diagnostic (infractions, time out of vehicle, performance reviews), Mission Specialists are given the best chance to succeed. Building Distrust in the System As our self-driving vehicle capabilities and performance increase over time, one may think that a Mission Specialist‚Äôs job gets easier. However, monitoring a system that fails less frequently over time is even more challenging than one that fails often. The reality is that a Mission Specialist who may have seen the vehicle stop at the same stop sign a thousand times before cannot presume that it will stop the next time. That is why the Learning and Development team‚Äôs goal, above all, is to develop a healthy level of distrust in the self-driving system. Organization-Wide Safety Management System Education As Uber ATG‚Äôs Safety Management System (SMS) begins to take shape, the Learning and Development team is widening its scope to ensure the broader organization understands how it contributes to safety, including how to use safety reporting tools, determine how safety-related decisions are made and who makes them, manager/leadership responsibilities within our SMS, and more. With guidance from our Safety Case Framework, we will deploy complementary educational initiatives across the company, including hosting company-wide workshops on topics such as Safety Ownership and Risk-Based Thinking. Preparing for the Future: Remote Operations As we look toward the future, the Learning and Development team aims to continue to support Uber ATG‚Äôs business needs, and supporting Remote Operations is a big part of that. While we will always support the in-vehicle Mission Specialist in whatever future scope they have, we are working closely with product and engineering teams to consider training needs for Remote Operators outside of the vehicle, focused on assisting the Rider and Autonomy when no one is behind the wheel of a self-driving car. Uber ATG has made a huge commitment to supporting Mission Specialists and has empowered the Learning and Development team to be an influential force within the organization. Having Mission Specialists in our vehicles is a crucial step to delivering a fully self-driving vehicle. This post only scratches the surface of the training that we undertake and we will continue to share our work so that we can move forward as an industry together. -- -- 2 We are rethinking the future of transportation.

https://medium.com/@belloc/5-ways-blockchain-is-changing-business-5b4530f8a7d1?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,5 ways blockchain is changing business‚Ä¶,Written by William Tien,William Tien,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in William Tien Follow -- 3 Listen Share Most media outlets advocating for or against blockchain focus primarily on the case of cryptocurrencies. Over the past couple of years, cryptocurrencies have made more headlines than ever before. This is particularly due to the volatility in the price of the most popularly known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. However, to pin Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as the embodiment of blockchain technology is akin to pinning email as the sole use case for the Internet. An alternative to mainstream fiat currencies is merely a single implementation of the potential for integrating a blockchain system. Below are 5 game-changing implementations of blockchain that most people wouldn‚Äôt immediately consider. IT and Cybersecurity Beyond just a currency, blockchain is a security protocol. It is a digital ledger that is immutable and essentially unhackable. Even big-name companies like Equifax, Target, and Yahoo have had data breaches in recent years that have led to the public dissemination of private information from millions of their users. The evolution of technology affects both sides of the spectrum; as security measures are refined, so too are the methods of hacking becoming more and more specialized to breach these security walls. Blockchain-backed security provides a way of recording transactions, or any digital interaction, in a way that is secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. Organizations like Kodak, Lockheed Martin, and even the US Department of Defense are studying the advantages that blockchain offers in protecting critical intellectual property. Social Networking Possibly one of the most critical needs for greater security is in our networking applications. Messaging platforms are now the primary means of communication for most users. Calls and SMS messages are now a secondary alternative. By default, messages are usually sent through platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, Telegram, WeChat, Instagram, or other such platforms. Occasionally, these messages may include private or sensitive documents, pictures, or recordings that the user trusts won‚Äôt be released to the general public. As such, it is imperative to implement encryption algorithms on top of higher security layers, like a blockchain, so that even in the event of a security breach the data is impossible to decrypt. Finance and Accounting Accounting is the textbook case study for a business field that can benefit significantly from blockchain technology. Tax codes are overwhelmingly complex and need the utmost precision and accuracy. Blockchain‚Äôs transparency allows for visibility to all transactions for approved users. This may decrease auditors‚Äô work with sampling and validating transactions, allowing them to focus on controls and investigating anomalies. Further, blockchain is having a significant effect on finance. Cross-border payments are complex with today‚Äôs banking infrastructure. The use of a shared digital ledger to record and verify transactions simplifies the entire process. The benefits for this model are numerous, including faster processing speeds (transferring money between countries in seconds, not days) and immensely lower transaction fees. Similarly, blockchain is an effective tool for identity verification and management. The technology decreases the incidence of money laundering and other such criminal financial activities. Healthcare The healthcare system, particularly in the US, has been the subject of a lot of controversy in recent years. Blockchain could be the solution to this, as it provides a more efficient method for maintaining the integrity of medical records. These records include the basic information of the patient as well as their medical history. Once these have been created and signed, by both the patient and their doctor, the information can be written into the blockchain to guarantee it cannot be tampered with. The authenticity of medical records is pivotal in caring for patients and upholding justice in legal cases that involve health care services. Blockchain can facilitate the process of consent management. The medical procedures a patient has consented to can be put on the blockchain where it can be accessed by anyone with the necessary permissions. The blockchain can also be used to track and reward patients who keep their appointments, stay healthy, and contribute their data to further clinical research. Advertising and Marketing Blockchain technology boosts credibility in marketing and public relations. It can aid PR firms in determining whether clicks and mentions on social media are from humans or bots. Companies that receive genuine human engagement are better positioned to improve customer loyalty and provide improved products and services. Companies that do not use blockchain technology in their marketing efforts may have less valid statistics. Juniper Research anticipates advertisers will lose an estimated $19 billion to fraudulent activities in 2019. This figure represents advertising on online and mobile devices. These losses are projected to reach as high as $44 billion by 2022. Blockchain systems can help dramatically reduce ‚Äúclick fraud,‚Äù ensuring marketing and advertising executives can reach their target markets. The principles of blockchain, historically developed as a prevention to banking fraud, can be applied to programmatic media buying by using the system to monitor and govern budget spend. Advertisers can track investment from the initial transfer of the media budget to the final publication of creative with the media owner. This preventative measure can help in reducing the risk of overcharging and underperformance. Blockchain technology can serve as a validator for PR firms to guarantee the originality of their press releases and social media posts. It also helps companies to publish their content across social media platforms and having a digital ledger with unreleased content may also improve content management. Companies can track all changes made to their records as well as the people who make them. These 5 examples of alternative blockchain implementation are only the beginning. Countless other cases are arising and ongoing projects are helping to pave the way towards a wider adoption. The next few years will form the foundation for the future of this novel technology and with further advancements in other tech sectors the possibilities for more efficient and reliable systems are limitless. -- -- 3 Futurist and advocate of time travel Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cr3aH3A-qpdr3WmdIvBGuw@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*cr3aH3A-qpdr3WmdIvBGuw@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*cr3aH3A-qpdr3WmdIvBGuw@2x.jpeg"

Solutions for excellent image quality and tackling the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù challenge effectively.,Streamer defeats opponents through Playkey,Playkey Team,No Author URL,N/A,14 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Playkey Team Follow -- Listen Share Cloud gaming has been hailed as one of the new technology changes to be excited about for 2019. Over the next 6 years, the cloud gaming market is expected to grow by 10 times ‚Äî from $45 million USD in 2018 to $450 million USD in 2024. Tech giants are already rushing in to develop the niche: Google and Nvidia have launched beta versions of their cloud gaming services, and Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, Amazon, and Verizon are preparing to storm the market. This is great news for gamers. Very soon, they will no longer need to sink ridiculous sums of money into the bottomless pit of hardware upgrades. They will finally be able to play the most power-hungry games on low-spec machines and achieve the same performance they would get from a super expensive system. But what about the other players in the ecosystem? Do publishers, developers, TV manufacturers, and telecom operators have anything to gain from this revolution? The answer is yes, and in this article, we‚Äôll be revealing a powerful tool that will allow them to penetrate this promising market and boost their revenue with minimal investment and negligible risk. Game publishers and developers are interested in delivering their product to as many players and as quickly as possible. But our data shows that currently, games are failing to reach up to 70% of their potential buyers. Players simply do not want to wait for a client and installation file weighing tens of gigabytes to download. Additionally, from the results of this survey, 60% of users do not have a computer that can handle demanding games (AAA level) at acceptable quality. Cloud gaming will be able to solve this problem. More importantly, it will not reduce the revenue of publishers and developers. On the contrary, it will help them build up a wider paying audience. The field of cloud gaming is now becoming attractive to TV and set-top box manufacturers. In the era of smart homes and voice assistants, they have to increasingly compete for the user‚Äôs attention. Offering game functionality is a key way to attract this attention. With integrated cloud gaming, they can offer their customers the ability to run modern games directly on their TV by paying a subscription fee for the service directly to the manufacturer. Another potentially active member of the ecosystem is a telecoms operator. Operators increase revenue by providing additional services ‚Äî gaming being one of these. Rostelecom has launched the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù tariff, while Akado sells access to our Playkey service. It is not just about broadband Internet operators. In connection with the active spread of 5G, mobile operators will also be able to take advantage of cloud gaming as an additional revenue stream. Despite the bright prospects, it‚Äôs not that easy to enter the market. All existing services, including products by tech giants, have not yet managed to completely overcome the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem. This means that due to the imperfection of the network, specifically in the house or apartment, the Internet speed of the user is not enough for cloud gaming to work correctly. Stakeholders who have been on the market for a long time and possess powerful resources are gradually moving towards solving this problem. But starting your cloud gaming service from scratch in 2019, means a massive investment, both financially and in opportunity cost. More importantly, there‚Äôs no guarantee of creating a working solution. But now, you have the opportunity of penetrating this rapidly-growing market, thanks to our new technology that allows you to launch your cloud gaming service quickly and at a fraction of the expense. Playkey began to develop its cloud gaming technology back in 2012. In 2014, the product was launched commercially, and by 2016, 2.5 million players had made use of the service at least once. Throughout the development, we have seen interest not only from gamers but also from TV set-top box manufacturers and telecom operators. We have even launched several pilot projects with NetByNet and Er-Telecom. In 2018, we decided that our product may have a B2B future. Developing a bespoke cloud gaming integration (as we did in pilot projects) for each company, poses a real challenge. Each such implementation takes from three months to six months. Why? Because every company has different hardware, operating systems, and requirements. One might need cloud gaming on an Android console, while someone like iFrame needs it in the web interface of a personal account for streaming to computers. Additionally, companies have different design and billing requirements, and other feature demands. It became clear that it was necessary either to increase the development team tenfold or to build the ultimate out-of-the-box B2B solution. In March 2019, we launched Remote Click ‚Äî a software that companies can install on their servers, which gives them a working cloud gaming service. On the client side, users will see a button on the familiar website, allowing them to launch a game in the cloud. When the button is clicked, the game will start on the company‚Äôs server, the user will receive the audio and video stream, and will be able to play remotely. That is what it might look like in popular digital game distribution services. Remote Click overcomes numerous technical barriers. The first generation of cloud gaming (such as OnLive) was destroyed by the poor quality of the Internet among its users. At the time, in 2010, the average Internet connection speed in the USA was only 4.7 Mbit/s. But by 2017, it had grown to 18.7 Mbit/s, and 5G is set to usher in a new era. But despite the fact that ‚Äî in general ‚Äî the infrastructure is ready for cloud gaming, the above mentioned ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem remains. First, there‚Äôs the ‚Äúexternal‚Äù element, where the user has problems with the network itself. For instance, the operator might not actually be providing the advertised maximum speed. Another case is where 2.4 GHz WiFi is being used, which might be receiving interference from a microwave oven or a wireless mouse. Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúinternal‚Äù element, where the user doesn‚Äôt even suspect that there might be a problem with the network (they don‚Äôt know that they don‚Äôt know)! At best, he or she is sure that if the operator is selling a connection of 100 Mbit/s, then the Internet connection is 100 Mbit/s. At worst, he or she has no idea what a router is, and thinks there‚Äôs such a thing as ‚Äúblue internet‚Äù and ‚Äúcolored internet‚Äù. This is an actual case from client development. But both parts of this ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem can be overcome. Remote Click uses active and passive mechanisms to achieve that. Here‚Äôs how those mechanisms work. 1. Effective Forward Error Correction (FEC) of transmitted data a.k.a redundancy When transmitting video data from the server to the client, we use forward error correction. This allows us to restore the original data in cases where it is partially lost due to network problems. What makes our solution effective? 2. Data reforwarding An alternative method to deal with losses is to request data again. For example, if the server and the user are in Moscow, the delay in transmission will not exceed 5 ms. With this value, the client application will have time to request and receive the lost part of the data from the server out of the sight of the user. Our system decides by itself when to apply redundancy, and when to apply reforwarding. 3. Customized data transfer To choose the best way to deal with losses, our algorithm analyzes the user‚Äôs network connection and sets up the data transmission system individually in each case. It looks at: If you rank the connections by losses and delays, then the cable is obviously the most reliable. Through Ethernet, losses are rare, and delays in the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù are extremely unlikely. Next comes WiFi 5 GHz and finally WiFi 2.4 GHz. Mobile connections are very poor quality, which is why we are waiting for 5G. When using WiFi, the system automatically configures the user‚Äôs adapter, putting it into the most suitable mode for use in the cloud (for example, turning off power saving). 4. Customized encoding Video streaming exists thanks to codecs ‚Äî programs for video compression and recovery. In the uncompressed form, one second of video easily exceeds one hundred megabytes, and the codec reduces this value by an order of magnitude. We are armed with H264 and H265 codecs. H264 is the most popular one. All major video card manufacturers have been supporting it at the hardware level over the past decade. H265 is a daring newcomer. It became supported by hardware five years ago. Encoding and decoding in H265 requires more resources, but the quality of the compressed frame is much higher than in H264. And without increasing the volume! But the big dilemma is, which codec should be chosen, and which encoding parameters should be set for a specific user, based on their hardware? It is a sophisticated problem that we solve automatically. The smart system analyzes the capabilities of the equipment, sets the optimal parameters of the encoder and selects a decoder on the client side. 5. Loss compensation Though it‚Äôs hard to admit, even our system is not perfect. Some of the data lost in the depths of the network cannot be recovered and we do not have time to reforward it. But in cases like this, there are still solutions. One method is by adjusting the bitrate. Our algorithm constantly controls the amount of data transmitted from the server to the client. It records every shortcoming and even predicts possible future losses. Its task is to monitor over time and, ideally, to predict when losses will reach a critical value that could result in flaws on the screen that are noticeable to the user, and control this by adjusting the amount of data transmitted (bitrate) at that moment. Additionally, we use the invalidation of unpicked frames and the mechanism of reference frames in the video stream. Both tools reduce the number of noticeable artifacts. That is, even with serious disruptions in data transmission, the image on the screen remains acceptable, and the game is playable. 6. Distributed transmission Data transmission distributed over time also improves the quality of streaming. The way in which it is distributed depends on specific indicators in the network, for example, the presence of losses, ping, and other factors. Our algorithm analyzes them and selects the best option. Sometimes distribution within a few milliseconds reduces losses by several times. 7. Reducing delay One of the key characteristics when playing through the cloud is a delay. A smaller delay results in a better gaming experience. The delay can be provisionally divided into two parts: The network delay depends on the infrastructure and it is problematic to deal with. If the wire is gnawed by a mouse, waving a dead chicken over it will not help. On the other hand, the system delay can be reduced by several times and the quality of cloud gaming for the player will change dramatically. In addition to the above mentioned forward error correction and personalized settings, we use two more mechanisms. With the use of our technology, with a network delay of 0 ms and working with a video stream of 60 FPS, the delay of the entire system does not exceed 35 ms. In our experience, many users have little idea of how their devices connect to the Internet. In an interview with players, it was discovered that some people do not know what a router is. And that‚Äôs fine! You do not have to know the structure of an internal combustion engine to drive a car. You should not require the user to have the knowledge of a system administrator to play a game. However, some technical points are still important to convey, so that players can independently remove barriers on their side. And we help them with this. 1. Indication of WiFi 5 GHz support Above, we wrote that we can see the Wi-Fi standard ‚Äî 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz. And we also know whether the network adapter of the user device supports the ability to operate at 5 GHz. If that‚Äôs the case, we recommend using this range. We cannot change the frequency on our own yet, as we are unable to see the characteristics of the router. 2. Indication of WiFi signal strength Some users can have a weak WiFi signal, even if the Internet works well and it seems that the speed is acceptable. The problem will be revealed particularly during cloud gaming, which puts the network under real test. Signal intensity is affected by obstacles ‚Äî for example, walls ‚Äî and interference from other devices. Microwave ovens are a common source of this. As a result, there are losses that are imperceptible when working on the Internet, but critical to cloud gaming. In such cases, we warn the user about the interference, we suggest finding a position closer to the router and turning off ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù devices. 3. Indication of traffic leeches Even if everything is fine with the network, other applications might be consuming too much traffic, for instance, if a video is running on Youtube while running a game in the cloud or downloading torrents. Our application calculates these traffic leeches and warns the player about them. Cloud games as a fundamentally new way of consuming game content, have been trying to break through to the market for almost a decade. And as in the case of any innovation, their story is a series of small victories and resounding defeats. It is not surprising that over the years cloud gaming has become overgrown with myths and prejudices. At the dawn of the technology, they were reasonable, but today they are completely groundless. Myth 1. The image in the cloud is worse than in the original ‚Äî as if playing on YouTube Today, in the technically advanced cloud solution, the images of the original and that of the cloud are almost identical ‚Äî there is no difference evident to the naked eye. Encoder customization based on the player‚Äôs equipment, in addition to a complex of mechanisms for dealing with losses, takes this issue off the table. There is no blurring of frames or graphics artifacts in a high-quality network. We even take resolution into account. It makes no sense to stream the picture in 1080p if the player uses 720p. Below are two Apex Legends videos from our channel. One video shows the game being played on a PC. The other shows the game being played in the cloud on Playkey. Apex Legends on PC Apex Legends on Playkey Myth 2. Unstable quality Network status is indeed inconsistent, but this problem has been resolved. We dynamically change the settings of the encoder based on the quality of the user‚Äôs network. We support a constantly acceptable level of FPS by special methods of image capture. How does it work? The game has a 3D engine that is used to build a 3D world. But the user is shown a flat image. In order to make the user see it, a picture of memory is created for each frame ‚Äî a kind of photograph of how this 3D world is seen from a certain point. This picture is stored in encoded form in the video memory buffer. We capture it from the video memory and transfer it to the encoder, which then decrypts it. And so on with each frame, one after another. Our technology allows you to capture and decode the image in one stream, which increases the FPS. And if these processes are conducted in parallel (a solution that is quite popular in the cloud gaming market), the encoder will constantly engage capture, take new frames with a delay and, accordingly, transfer them with a delay. Myth 3. Due to lags in the controls, I will be a ‚Äúsnail‚Äù in multiplayer Normal delay in control amounts to a few milliseconds and is usually imperceptible to the end user. But sometimes there is a tiny delay between the movement of the mouse and the resulting cursor movement. This does not affect anything but creates a negative impression. The technique mentioned earlier, of rendering the cursor directly on the user‚Äôs device, eliminates this disadvantage. Other than that, the total system delay of 30‚Äì35 ms is so small that neither the player nor his/her rivals in the match will notice anything. The outcome of the battle is purely dependent on skill. Here‚Äôs a clear example of this. vk.com Cloud gaming is already a reality. Playkey, PlayStation Now, and Shadow are working services with their own audience and market place. And like many young markets, cloud gaming will grow rapidly in the coming years. One of the scenarios that seems most likely to us is the emergence of private services owned by game publishers and telecom operators. Some of them will develop their own solutions, others will use ready-made out-of-the-box solutions like RemoteClick.net. The more players on the market, the faster the cloud-based way of consuming game content will become the mainstream. P.S.

There have been multiple approaches to building FWA; WiMAX can be considered as a fixed wireless access solution. Even LTE can serve as a foundation for FWA. The key difference between a 5G FWA solution and any other FWA solution is their performance. WiMAX is the widely accepted wireless solution providing 10 Mbps download speeds; an LTE solution supports 10‚Äì100 Mbps speeds. A 5G solution can deliver speeds per second in gigabits, which means 10 to 20 times faster than 4G. Multiple 5G test trails have been conducted by different vendors across the world, and they have reported the downlink speeds of up to 25 Gbps. Thus, owing to faster speeds and low latency, this technology directly competes with fiber-like or high-speed broadband access networks 5G, as a fixed wireless solution, was not in focus until companies such as Verizon and AT&T started discussing the possible impact of 5G FWA on mobile phones, smart homes, connected cars, and smart cities, among various other applications. These companies also plan to launch 5G FWA solutions for end users much before the commercial launch of 5G services. In October 2018, Verizon launched a 5G FWA service in 4 US cities, namely, Houston, Indianapolis, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. The company is offering typical speeds of 300 Mbps with peaks of 940 Mbps in the price range of USD 50‚Äì70. The market potential for 5G FWA is massive. The discussion of 5G FWA started with providing internet access solutions to rural areas where it is not possible to have a fiber connection, as well as to semi-urban areas that have limited access to a fiber connection. This market has the potential to target nearly 1,100 million subscribers by 2021 in terms of a number of subscribers.The growth and future opportunities of the 5G fixed wireless access market is driven by the factors such as surging demand for high-speed internet connectivity and broad network coverage with reduced latency and power consumption, increasing adoption of advanced technologies such as machine-to-machine (M2M)/lnternet of Things (IoT), growing use of millimeter-wave technology in 5G FWA, rising demand for 5G FWA networks from varied industries, remarkable progress in telecommunications and networking technologies, escalating requirement for IoT and cloud-based services, development of 5G network, and strategic partnerships with system integrators in emerging economies. The government will play a significant role in the success of the 5G FWA. First, the government can provide operators with the spectrum they need to support high-speed wireless services. Second, governments should create regulations that facilitate deployments, such as making laws that speed up the ability of an operator to install small outdoor cells. Governments can take a proactive stand and even encourage investments for both suburban and rural areas in new high-speed infrastructure. The US telecom regulator made a new rule opening up 11GHz of spectrum for 5G deployments above the 24GHz band. The newly released spectrum includes 3.85GHz (27.5‚Äì28.35GHz), 37GHz (37‚Äì38.6GHz), 39GHz (38.6‚Äì40GHz) and 64‚Äì71GHz (7GHz) unlicensed spectrum.North America is considered as the most advanced region in terms of well-established infrastructure and the adoption of advanced technologies. The wide presence of key industry players offering 5G FWA solutions is the main factor responsible for the dominance of North America in the 5G fixed wireless access market. For instance, Qualcomm Technologies (US), Mimosa Networks, Inc. (US), Cohere Technologies, Inc. (US), Cellular South, Inc. (C Spire) (US), TELUS Corporation (Canada), United States Cellular Corporation (LIS), AT&T Inc. (US), Verizon Communications Inc. (US), Cisco (LIS) are a few major companies from the region that are actively participating in the development of 5G FWA solutions. In June 2017, AT&T launched the second trial using millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in Austin, Texas. The second trial delivered a connection to residential consumers, small businesses, and enterprises using Ericsson‚Äôs 5G RAN and the Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform. The trial participants streamed premium live TV via DIRECTV NOW and experienced faster broadband services ‚Äî all over a fixed wireless 5G signal. Also, in Ericsson‚Äôs 5G RAN and the Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform. The trial participants streamed premium live TV via DIRECTV NOW and experienced faster broadband services ‚Äî all over a fixed wireless 5G signal. Also, in June 2018, Samsung (South Korea) and Cisco (LIS) entered into a partnership agreement with Verizon (US) to deploy the 5G trial network in the LIS. In this network implementation, Cisco (US) provided a virtualized ultra-services platform with advanced services, while Samsung provided the virtual RAN in connection with Samsung‚Äôs 5G radio base stations and 5G home routers. This would strengthen the position of North America in the 5G fixed wireless access market. Following are some of the major 5G FWA test trials ‚Äî Samsung (South Korea) and Arqiva (UK) Completed Trial Test of 5G FWA Technology in the UK and Europe‚Ä¢ AT&T Inc.

(C Spire) (US), Orange SA (France), United States Cellular Corporation (US ).We believe that 5G will drive innovative services and could transform telco operators in multiple industries from simple connectivity providers into broad service and solution providers. At the same time, 5G opens up opportunities for non-telco players, especially businesses and neutral urban infrastructure providers, to enter the mobile arena to participate directly in shaping the future digital ecosystem of other businesses, cities and countries as a whole. Governments seeking to improve the stature of their countries must accelerate processes of spectrum allocation at attractive costs so that operators and companies within their jurisdictions can join the 5G race. They will make it possible for their countries to become leading 5 G markets, with all the benefits that imply.The 5G leadership competition will increase dramatically in 2019/2020, with major commercial network launches expected worldwide, enabled by new spectrum allocations and driven by increased business demand. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*PdisKz4gwru8_NET, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*PdisKz4gwru8_NET, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*PdisKz4gwru8_NET"

Some of the most renowned and beloved car brands are tapping into DLT, as Blockchain writes a new chapter for the industry with evangelist confident that the Automotive industry will be next in line to be disrupted by this new nascent technology. Even more so, 95% of Automotive manufacturers are planning on making ‚Äò‚Äômoderate to significant‚Äù investments in the technology with Enterprise through endowing startups to aid the development of potential blockchain-based solutions. What‚Äôs driving ‚Äò‚ÄôConnected car‚Äô‚Äô services will be the marriage of Automotive technologies & Blockchain. The technology is set to provide a ‚Äò‚Äômuch-needed‚Äô‚Äô change that‚Äôs capable of addressing key issues faced by the struggling automotive industry. At the moment, enterprises are busy testing out blockchain-pilots with the clear intention of driving innovation and solutions across the entire ecosystem, or where it‚Äôs most applicable. To get a better idea of the disruptive impact of DLT, here are several use-cases in which Blockchain will reshape the automobile industry: Commerce: Since data integrity plays a vital role in modern finance where problems can arise when an error occurs as the result of manual data entry, facilitating trade, and data management. Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) is meant to streamline these processes, allowing independent parties to keep an accurate record of a vehicle‚Äôs lifetime. Supply Chain: Thousands of parts are needed to manufacture a car, a process which involves an extensive network of individuals, organizations, resources & activities. Due to the complexity of managing large supply chains, parts are essentially at risk of being damaged, stolen, and replaced. By Implementing DLT to further manage the supply chain, companies will have an effective & efficient means of tracking all the components from the day it‚Äôs produced, to it being shipped as the final product. Mobility: The involvement of Third-parties such as insurance, maintenance, and even cleaning services requires vehicle owner to disclose confidential information. The use of Blockchain allows customers to manage personal data and share that information with third-party service providers. On-demand mobility services (MaaS) through integration of Blockchain, allows various forms of transport services into a single mobility services that‚Äôs made accessible on demand. MaaS is often used to describe a shift away from personally-owned modes of transportation and towards mobility solutions, solutions consumed as a service such as Ride-sharing is a good example. However, there‚Äôs one area in which Blockchain will have the biggest impact and is set to disrupt, which has to do with Connected Car Technologies. The next digital revolution to have a deep impact on the automotive industry will be all about communication and autonomous vehicle. For now, there are several trends that seem to be shaping the future of Connected Cars. The term ‚Äò‚Äôconnected car‚Äô‚Äô is used to describe the digitization of IoT-compatible cars and advances in technology that allow vehicles to communicate & connect with one another over a Network. It‚Äôs true that Connectivity will be one of the main factors driving the connected cars development, and Blockchain is set to play a vital role when it comes to improving the quality and speed of vehicle communications. DLT has the ability to store asset ownership rights, settle transactions as part of a globalized payment system, and allow for greater transparent Supply-chain management Hyundai Motor Group‚Äôs subsidiary, Hyundai AutoEver, has announced a formal partnership with Blocko, a South Korean firm that specializes as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider. Blocko has signed a MoU with Hyundai Motor Group‚Äôs ICT platform, with the intention of teaming up to develop an in-house platform for the Automotive giant. With the help of Blocko, Hyundai is applying Blockchain to safeguarding vehicle‚Äôs ownership, allowing the tracking of confidential vehicle information such as mileage, service history and age. The BaaS provider also specializes in open-source solutions, introducing Aergo, Blocko‚Äôs latest undertaking that is set to allow Enterprises to make greater use of decentralized technology without having to comprise, by introducing a unique Hybrid Blockchain. Hyundai has announced that its platform will be migrating to Aergo Mainnet, giving us a glimpse of a future where Automotive giants are keen to utilize a more open and public blockchain of choice. For now, Hyundai intends to use a blockchain-powered platform for vehicle lifecycle management, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and insurance. The Hyundai affiliate company that manages the IT for all 54 of Hyundai Motors Group‚Äôs systems. You can read more about it here. The german car brand has been supportive of Blockchain back in 2018, publicly announcing that it will use the technology as a way to share self-driving car data among Network participants. In an attempt to utilize valuable data collected by self-driving vehicles, BMW plans to use Blockchain to overcome one of the biggest barriers hindering the mass adoption of autonomous by essentially unlocking data that is being kept in silos. In the past, BMW has collaborated with Blockchain-based startups such as Vechain to work on the firm‚Äôs VerifyCar app which designed to entitle each owner, a digital passport of their vehicle. The firm also plans to use the technology to combat manipulated odometers, which is estimated to cost $6.78 billion annually in Germany alone. BMW has also joined the ‚Äò‚ÄôMobility open Blockchain initiative‚Äô‚Äô, a group that was formed with the goal of implementing blockchain to make mobility safer, greener, cheaper and more accessible. In the coming years, BMW will be one of the pioneers in the automotive industry to implement DLT for a number of concepts ranging from supply-chain management, to interconnected autonomous vehicles. An automobile manufacturer that specializes in high-performance luxury sports cars has partnered up with the Berlin-based startup, XAIN, to test blockchain applications to be integrated in Porsche vehicles. Porsche is said to be the first car manufacturer to implement and successfully test Blockchain according to statements made by company. Over the years, Porsche is said to be piloting the technology for the application of locking and unlocking a vehicle, with the grand idea of letting car owners temporarily give someone access to their car In addition to testing, in the past Porsche has finalized a $170 Million loan using Blockchain, by completing a deal with Banco Bilboa Vizcaya Argentaria‚Äôs (BBVA), a Spanish bank known for being a Blockchain advocate and issuing out syndicated corporate loans. Porsche has officially become the first non-Spanish company to complete an acquisition term loan that has been entirely arranged through distributed ledger Industrializing the Blockchain for the Automotive Industry It‚Äôs expected that Automotive Industry will benefit from new technological advancements throughout the years and perhaps even write a new chapter for the sector. With the introduction of electric cars, full autonomy and ride sharing services, there is the possibility of a seismic shift that could lead to a future where Blockchain is the ideal solution for the management of data. Leave it to automotive companies to refine and redefine existing technologiesby introducing new, exciting concepts like artificial intelligence and connected cars with the end-goal of giving us a driving experience that will be like nothing we‚Äôve ever known before. A tipping point can be expected within the next five years, as there are several factors such as the impact of changes inautomotive ownerships, the release of sales models and the greater acceptance & adoption of Blockchain. For now, DLT is finding its way to apply concrete applications within the automotive sector offering a wide-range of viable solutions. This is a period of pilots and trials, prior to the wholesale adoption of technology since we‚Äôre at an early stage. -- -- Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Atatiana Jefferson, Tamir Rice, Bettie Jones, Botham Jean Blockchain Developer in the making, who has embarked on a journey to deploy his own dApps!

Meaning that you shouldn‚Äôt focus on your own needs when designing for others, which is sage advice ‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôve chosen to completely ignore. I‚Äôm designing exclusively for myself now. I‚Äôm making femme-forward technologies that meet my needs, challenging expectations of how technology is developed by centering identity and putting the holistic human back into the design process. For context, I‚Äôm a product designer, inventor, and design-researcher and my medium is technology. I work with all of it ‚Äî hardware, software, fabrication tools, etc. ‚Äî which makes me more of breadth designer than a depth designer (which is my sweet spot). Before starting my own R&D lab ‚Äî Digital Culture Club ‚Äî I was in academia (both as student and teacher) for a long time ‚Äî hi Parsons and Carnegie Mellon and Dartmouth College! And while I was in academia, I studied the history of technology design. When studying the history of tech two things become readily apparent: I don‚Äôt know about you, but these two tenets of technology make me sad. I identify as a woman, as does over 50% of the world, yet my lived experience in the world is rarely taken into account when technologies are designed still to this day. A memorable example of designing without women in mind is this first iteration of the Oculus Rift which produced profound motion sickness in women users ‚Äî who process motion distinctly from men, yet their experience with the Rift was not properly vetted before release. The arguments about gender imbalance and being left out may be obvious, but my frustration over #2 ‚Äî that computing technologies prioritize workplace optimization issues ‚Äî may be more subtle. My point is this, while yes humans value work and being efficient, we‚Äôre also complex beings, who can be profoundly funny and silly, we feel emotions, our decisions can make no sense to others, we love one another, and grieve those we lose, and the technologies we use should allow us to be fully expressive ‚Äî not just tools for making us work harder/better/faster. Our technologies should allow us to be more human, instead of making us more like the logical systems that run technologies. As a designer/inventor, the obvious reaction for my frustrations with the current state of technology production is to make things that suggest the world I want to live in. I‚Äôve developed design frameworks that center humor, play, and femme-forward experiences in the tech prototypes that I‚Äôve been developing in my new R&D lab called Digital Culture Club (post about DCC soon!). We‚Äôve produced a lot of work that‚Äôs challenging the current state of modern computing and the tropes we‚Äôve come to accept as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how tech is‚Äù, such as endless notifications, invasions of privacy, addictive and dark patterns. One body of work I‚Äôm especially proud of is the line of Digits Nails Technologies we‚Äôve produced. Digits Nails Technologies are press-on nails that incorporate interactive technologies that are playful, often humorous, and forward the feminine experience in designing the affordances of the interactions. My next post will discuss the design process for the nails, including the problems they solve and how observation was a key design research method that led to their creation. In the meanwhile, I hope you enjoy the video of our RFID ‚ÄòTap and Go‚Äô bus pass nails allowing me to pay my bus fare with the tap of a nail. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts about what aspects of your life ‚Äî femme-forward or holistically human ‚Äî you‚Äôd like to see technology designers pay more attention to.

Since JavaScript does not have any type-checking, either of these keywords can be used to declare a variable of any type (datatype) in JavaScript. Though all the three keywords are used for the same purpose, they are different. Variables declared using the let keyword can change their values in the future. Consider the example given below: Output: On the first line, the variable iChange is declared using the let keyword and is initialized with value 11. When you come down to the next line, the variable iChange is again assigned a new value, which is 12. Changing the values of variables declared using the let keyword is allowed. When, on the last line, you try to print the value of the variable iChange, you correctly get the updated value 12. Variables declared using the const keyword cannot change their values in future. This is why you must always initialize the variables declared with the const keyword. Output: Here, the variable PI is declared using the const keyword and is initialized with value 3.14 on the first line. When you come down to the next line, the variable PI is updated with a new value 22/7. Changing values of variables declared using the const keyword is not allowed. This is why the second line throws the error shown in the output because you are trying to assign a new value to a constant variable. Therefore, remember that variables declared using the const keyword are read-only & cannot be reassigned any value. As mentioned earlier, it is mandatory to initialize a constant when declaring it. Let‚Äôs see the following statement of code: Output: You know that you cannot update a constant in future. If you do not initialize a constant during its declaration, you will not be able to assign any value to it EVER! This is why you get a SyntaxError when you leave a constant uninitialized. What do you think will be the output of the code given below? Do you think an error will be thrown? Let‚Äôs check the output. Here we go. Output: The objects (including arrays & functions) declared using the const keyword are mutable. So far, you‚Äôve learned that variables declared using the const keyword cannot be assigned any other value. While this is true, there‚Äôs another side of the story too. Undoubtedly, you cannot assign a new value to a constant but you can manipulate the existing value if it is an object or an array. In the code given above, you are not changing the entire value assigned to the constant passengerBus but you are manipulating a property inside it. You can add/delete/update a property inside an object declared using the const keyword. Similar can be done with arrays too. You can add add/delete/update an element inside an array declared using a const keyword. Output: Now, considering that the keywords let and const belong to the same category, the following points enlist the differences between the variables declared using the let/const keywords and the variables declared using the var keyword: Variables declared using the let/const keywords are block-scoped. Consider the following example: Output: The variable i is declared using the let keyword inside the for-loop block. This means that when the for-loop block ends, the variable i loses its scope and is no longer accessible outside the curly braces of the for-loop block. Thus, when you try to access the variable i and print its value on statement 2, you get a ReferenceError: i is not defined, as shown in the output. Consider another example of declaring a variable using the const keyword: Output: The variable message is declared using the const keyword inside the if-block. This means that when the if-block ends, the variable message loses its scope and is no longer accessible outside the curly braces of the if-block. This is why, when you try to access variable message and print its value on statement 2, you get a ReferenceError: message is not defined, as shown in the output. Variables declared using the var keyword are function-scoped. Consider the example which we‚Äôve discussed earlier where instead of using let, you use the var keyword to declare the variable i: Output: The variable i is declared using the var keyword inside the for-loop-block. Because the variables declared using the var keyword are function-scoped, the variable i does not go out of scope when the for-loop-block ends and is accessible anywhere inside the scope of the function foo. Thus, on statement 2, when you try to access the variable i and print its value, you get the correct output as 3 (incremented value of variable i after the for-loop‚Äôs increment statement is executed) as shown in the output. Variables declared using the let/const keywords cannot be redeclared in the same scope. What do you think will be the output of the following code? Output: In the above code, you declared a variable with the name avengers using the let keyword and then you declared it again on the next line. Thus, the second line throws an SyntaxError as mentioned in the output. Variables declared using the var keyword can be redeclared in the same scope. Let‚Äôs now declare a variable already declared earlier in the same scope using the var keyword. Output: As evident from the output , you can redeclare variables having the same name in the same scope using the var keyword. The value contained in the variable will be the final value that you have assigned to it. Variables declared using the let/const keywords are NOT hoisted. This is an important point which is forgotten by many and you won‚Äôt find it in all articles. To understand what this point means, consider the example given below: Output: Notice that on the first line in the code given above, you are trying to access a variable x, which is declared and assigned a value on the next line. Essentially, you are trying to access a variable, which has not yet been allocated memory (declared). Since the variable x is declared using the let keyword and the variables declared using the let/const keywords are not hoisted, this throws a ReferenceError: x is not defined, as shown in the output. Variables declared using the var keyword are hoisted to the top of their scope. Output: All the declarations are moved to the top of the scope. Notice that on the first line, you are trying to access a variable x, which is declared and assigned a value on the next line. Now, since the variable x is declared using the var keyword and the variables declared using the var keyword are hoisted to the top of their scope in JavaScript, the code gets converted to the one given below: Here, the variable x is declared on line 1 and is not assigned any value. All the variables in JavaScript are initialized with the default value undefined, if no other value is assigned explicitly by the user. Thus, x is assigned the value undefined, which is what is printed on the second line (before x is updated to 10). ES6 (aka ES2015) is supported by almost all the browsers today. If you can follow this syntax, it is recommended to use the let and const keywords for declaring all the variables in your code. Now, which one to choose amongst let and const? The title says it all. -- -- We‚Äôve moved to https://freecodecamp.org/news and publish tons of tutorials each week. See you there.

Peaster,William M. Peaster,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in William M. Peaster Follow -- Listen Share What unified values should unite the Ethereum community, at least generally speaking? It‚Äôs a question that many stakeholders around the project have been grappling with. For example, Gnosis team member Eric Conner recently asked the Ethfinance forum to offer some ideas on the most exciting things about Ethereum. Why? Because Conner wanted to use the answers to inform the creation of a new page on the EthHub, a popular information portal in the space. The idea was to help the Ethereum community move toward a more coherent set of values to make the project more approachable, as Conner explained: ‚ÄúBitcoin stands for a set of fairly clear things (‚Äúsound money‚Äù, anti-hyperinflation, anti-statism, censorship resistance, digital gold‚Ä¶), but ethereum generally lacks those clear things.‚Äù I humbly agree with Conner ‚Äî making it easier to articulate what Ethereum is about and what it can do will only help the platform reach new users of all stripes. But what are the most important things to articulate? I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else or for all the values that Ethereum might have, but I do think neutrality is a value worth further honing in on going forward. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs the only value or even the most important value of Ethereum, or that it hasn‚Äôt been stressed as a key aspect of Ethereum before; rather, while the community is grappling with values, I think it‚Äôs worthwhile to raise a banner here. Neutrality is simple, highly memeable (e.g. think Switzerland), and relates to other key themes, like Open Finance, decentralization, and beyond. I‚Äôm far from the first person to harp on neutrality. Indeed, Bitcoin and Ethereum are as popular as they currently are in no small part thanks to their structural neutrality. In its ‚ÄúPhilosophy‚Äù section, the Ethereum whitepaper itself reads: ‚ÄúNon-discrimination and non-censorship: the protocol should not attempt to actively restrict or prevent specific categories of usage. All regulatory mechanisms in the protocol should be designed to directly regulate the harm and not attempt to oppose specific undesirable applications. A programmer can even run an infinite loop script on top of Ethereum for as long as they are willing to keep paying the per-computational-step transaction fee.‚Äù In other words? Ethereum is a new kind of public infrastructure that is totally neutral. Accordingly, with this post I‚Äôm just highlighting the potential usefulness of ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù in a rhetorical sense. It condenses ‚Äî or provides an approachable gateway to ‚Äî some of the more jargon-y memes about the promises of blockchain. It‚Äôs a lot easier to immediately understand than ‚Äúcensorship-resistance,‚Äù ‚Äúsound money,‚Äù and even ‚Äúdecentralization.‚Äù Again, I‚Äôm not reinventing the wheel here. I thought I‚Äôd just put my two gwei in after thinking about Conner‚Äôs call to action. The thing is, people don‚Äôt have to be neutral to use Ethereum. It‚Äôs because Ethereum is neutral that it can be home to anyone. A reminder of that neutrality in action is the SpankChain project, which has become a redoubt for some deplatformed sex workers that have been kicked off of mainstream payments portals like PayPal and its ilk. Ethereum is not similarly moralistic to the point of restricting freedoms; pay your fees, and the world computer will handle the rest. Neutral, programmable money is an unprecedented development in civilization. Whenever a newcomer asks about Ethereum, neutrality is a concept that can quickly bring them up to speed on why the platform is unique and valuable. Ethereum is for individuals and for enterprises. It‚Äôs for activists and bureaucrats, developers and artists, states and non-state actors. It‚Äôs a new kind of public infrastructure that‚Äôs for anyone, anywhere. And in a world where globalization is rapidly accelerating, that may just be a winning argument. In fact, it‚Äôs an argument that‚Äôs already proven relatively popular. *** William M.

In this article, we highlight five product innovations from Asia in 2019. Toyota: Solar Panel Electric Vehicles In July 2019, Toyota announced test trials of a new version of their plug-in hybrid Prius equipped with Sharp solar panels on the roof, hood, and rear hatch door. These solar panels have an astounding efficiency of 34 percent-plus and generates an output of around 860W, almost five times more than the standard Prius model. Sony: Personal A/C In July 2019, the hottest month ever recorded in history, Sony unveiled the Reon Pocket. It‚Äôs a personal, wallet sized thermoelectric powered A/C that is inserted into the back of a shirt. The device is controlled by an app, and can lower the user‚Äôs body temperature by 23F or raise it by 14F. It is expected to be released in Japan in March 2020 at a cost of about $117 USD. Smoking Cabin SG: Outdoor Smoking Cabin In May 2019, in Singapore, Smoking Cabin SG launched an outdoor smoking cabin that converts 99.5% of cigarette smoke into clean air. The air filtration system is activated by motion sensors when a smoker enters the cabin, and can house up to 10 smokers at a time. The company plans to have 60 cabins nationwide by the end of 2019. Vincross: Robot Plant In May 2019, a six-legged robot plant, Hexa, was nominated for a DRIVENxDESIGN‚Äôs NOW Award. Hexa can carry a small succulent plant on its back and automatically moves around to find sunlight and shade as needed for the plant. It can also sense when the plant needs water and will dance to alert the owner. It can be purchased for about $949 USD. Mitsubishi: Premium Toaster In April 2019, Mitsubishi Electric launched the Bread Oven. This premium toaster heats one slice of bread at a time to perfection by trapping in moisture. This makes the toast taste like freshly baked bread. The toaster can also be used to make French toast, cheese toast, or an egg on top. It can be purchased for about $270 USD.

https://medium.com/@sgsm.viv/new-cloud-technology-challenging-blockchain-and-all-cryptocurrencies-ef49db453933?source=tag_archive---------164-----------------------,New Cloud Technology Challenging Blockchain and all Cryptocurrencies,Written by VL IV,VL IV,No Author URL,N/A,13 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in VL IV Follow -- Listen Share A new technology called RAIDA (Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents), used to detect the authenticity of a new cloud-based digital currency ‚Äî CloudCoin, aims to challenge the technology (Blockchain) standing behind Bitcoin. The name of the challenger is CloudCoin‚Ñ¢ CloudCoin‚Ñ¢ is a cloud-based digital currency that makes some substantial claims. It claims that it cannot be counterfeited, controlled, or tracked. That it cannot be double-spent, mined or lost. That it is 100% private and requires no public ledgers, accounts, or encryption. And that it is a completely fair and ethical monetary system. CloudCoin and its underlying technology named RAIDA has ambitious plans.At this point, even if the claims are true, it sounds like David and Goliath ‚Ä¶ but we all know how that story ended, could this be the same?And even if it‚Äôs a new mouse trap with improvements ‚Ä¶ does it matter? CloudCoin and RAIDA aim to challenge Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. Let‚Äôs look at how it claims to challenge Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in multiple areas. Actually, let‚Äôs take a close lookBased upon my understanding, these are not just surface changes. The term paradigm-changing probably has been used more often than it should, but if simultaneous changes in speed, security, anonymity, cost, ecological footprint, and impenetrability can be (or may already have been,) accomplished by CloudCoin, then the world has actually changed and it‚Äôs only a matter of time for people to recognize it and catch up.So, lots of big aims and big claims. Let‚Äôs peek beneath the hood. RAIDA History The RAIDA project was created by Sean H. Worthington, a professor who was working on a PhD (Computer Information Systems) dissertation on an artificial intelligent object recognition system that could recognize and identify money for vending machines. The system used Worthington‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagic Neuron‚Äù design that required many computes to act like neurons. The data store could be taught and could memorize the notes. He understood that he could create a brain in the cloud that could identify millions of individual notes and even be taught to recognize changes. In August 2016, Worthington minted 16,777,216 CloudCoin notes and registered them with the RAIDA ‚Äî then in experimental development.After filing a provisional patent, he set out to create the RAIDA. The provisional patent was granted (#62354022). Because he realized the potential scope of what he was trying to accomplish, and that monetary systems are information systems, Worthington first needed to recruit world-class Systems Administrators throughout the world. This has been completed. System Administrators and Programmers joined the ‚ÄúCloudCoin Consortium‚Äù from numerous countries including Taiwan, Philippines, Japan, India, Serbia, Russia, Germany, UK, Macedonia, Venezuela, Columbia, USA, Italy and others. Once the extensive network was in place the proof of concept tests were conducted in January 2017. These tests showed conclusively that the CloudCoin invention worked in practice as it did in theory. RAIDAtech This is the development company for the RAIDA technology, who is pioneering new uses of the patented RAIDA technology, the first and foremost being CloudCoin. RAIDA is an acronym for the * Redundant* Array of* Independent* Detection* Agents What makes it up? How does it work? What makes it safer? What are the benefits?First, let‚Äôs address ‚Äúwhat is RAIDA?‚Äù https://cloudcoin.global/raida.htmlhttp://www.cloudcoinwiki.com/RAIDA In short, RAIDA is a decentralized cloud-based technology consisting of 25 of 25 independent clouds of servers. The clouds store and process CloudCoin files.These Clouds are hidden in different countries around the planet: Australia, Macedonia, Philippines, Serbia, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, UK, India, Germany, USA, Taiwan, Russia, France, Singapore, Argentina and Canada. Each of these clouds consist of a Sentinel and 32 Detection Agents. The RAIDA is a new authentication protocol that is the first of its kind and the first true Cloud-based authentication system. Most authentication protocols require one password to be given to one server that is checked against one database. The RAIDA uses many passwords against many different servers each with a no-share database. This allows to have decentralized authentication, fault tolerance, high availability and tamper proof data. CONSTANT MONITORING https://raida.cloudcoinconsortium.com/The status of the RAIDA network is always monitored and can be observed by anyone. The RAIDA continually updates about every 30 seconds. A key difference between Bitcoin and CloudCoin‚Ñ¢ is that all the coding is contained within the CloudCoin‚Ñ¢ itself. NO PUBLIC KEY A public key provides a route for the unlikely, but not impossible, hacking of Bitcoin. This is especially true for a number of super computers working in tandem, let alone a quantum computer. Being public, it also provides information on the values of what is being transmitted, and to a thief this could look like an armoured car transporting a large amount of money and therefore being a difficult, but tempting target. Thinking of the hacker being part of a well-funded crime syndicate, huge competitor or unfriendly government, the target must be tempting enough for the thieves to even consider investing a considerable amount of their time, energy and resources. Here‚Äôs a quote that was attributed to an infamous American bank robber named Willie Sutton when asked a question of why he robbed banks. His reply was: ‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs where the money is.‚Äù CloudCoin TRANSMISSIONS ARE INDIVIDUAL They are not batched. With CloudCoin you do not have an ‚Äúarmoured truck‚Äù carrying a big load of money. Additionally, there isn‚Äôt any kind of value indicator to let anyone know whether there are only a few CloudCoins being sent to a friend, or millions that are being transmitted in business. But what if there is some hacker who has access to huge computing power, but isn‚Äôt very practical, or has a lot of time to waste? Not likely. But perhaps a team of hackers who are part of a crime syndicate, an unscrupulous banking organization, or some corrupt government? HERE‚ÄôS FEW THINGS THE HACKERS WOULD NEED TO CONFRONT! - Each line of the authenticity code consists of a 16-byte password that is 100% random. - Most authentication protocols require one password to be given to one server that is checked against one database. The RAIDA uses many passwords against many different servers, each with a no-share database. - Presuming that a hacker were able to find one of the hidden detection agents and capture it, and then break its code, the hacker would only have 1/32 of 1/25th of the authentication data. So, even if a hacker could decrypt it, doing that would not provide ownership of any coins. - In order to crack a CloudCoin, a hacker would nearly simultaneously need to guess the Authenticity Numbers of a majority of the RAIDA located around the world. - The RAIDA also has a bottleneck of how many codes can be guessed at each second. This is like when you forget or mistype a passcode three times and you get locked out. The public ledger does not have a bottleneck. With a public ledger, a hacker could make as many guesses as they have servers. If a hacker has a football field full of supercomputers (like the NSA), then they could guess trillions of combinations per second. With quantum computers, a hacker could guess all combinations within two minutes and crack the Blockchain. - With RAIDA, a hacker is limited to only guess 8 million guesses per second, per RAIDA. If one were to take the time to run the math, it would clearly show that it would take more guesses than there is the time in the Universe to crack a CloudCoin. Therefore, the RAIDA is also quantum safe. HOW IS THE SYSTEM ITSELF SAFE FROM ATTACK OR HARM? - The clouds are scattered all around the world in secret locations. - RAIDA servers do not require large computer facilities which are easy to spot. - CloudCoin has a very small electrical footprint. This not only ensures its financial and ecological viability, but also eliminates the possibility of locating one of the RAIDA servers through the monitoring of electrical consumption. - RAIDA has data redundancy for instantaneous backup and is self-healing. If one of the detection agents gets knocked out, it is automatically replaced by a new one. WHAT ARE CloudCoin‚Äôs MAJOR BENEFITS? 1. Users can remain completely anonymous. Not pseudo anonymous as with Bitcoin. In this regard CloudCoins are like paper money. Naturally, you would keep your own records, and have accounts with businesses, and handle your responsibilities, but anonymity is your decision and there is no ledger tracking your business or who you transact with. 2. Cannot be manipulated. Governments and banks publicize horrible things to manipulate people into agreeing to give up their freedom. They use emotionally charged things like drugs, child pornography, sex trafficking, terrorism and others as a justification, or a reason, for you to give up your anonymity, your freedom and the control of your finances. These ‚Äúwe have to protect you‚Äù justifications all seem reasonable to well-intentioned people, but when you look behind the curtain you can see that they are being used by unscrupulous powers to justify their efforts to take control of your finances. Restricting your freedom and taking away your rights is not the correct solution to handle these problems. 3. Your money or wealth is not limited to, or controlled by one economic system. It‚Äôs not restricted by borders. With CloudCoin you could think of your money as invisible and international. 4. Because the file sizes are very small, they require very little storage and transmit quickly. On the server level, there is no need for large, expensive and energy consuming storage. 5. On a personal level, CloudCoin wallets are under 5 MB and download in a few minutes compared with a huge Bitcoin wallet that may take days to download. 6. CloudCoin transaction speeds are blazingly fast, with authentications measured in milliseconds. 8 000 000 TPS 7. Utility value: In a practical sense, a currency is only as valuable as it makes trade safer and easier. With CloudCoin it only takes a few seconds for a retail merchant, who has people waiting in line at a checkout counter, to check authenticity, and be paid. 8. Transaction costs are pennies, making small purchases like a cup of coffee viable. 9. CloudCoin wallets are free and can be downloaded by anyone. 10. You can send a CloudCoin to anyone on earth who has a computer, smartphone or tablet, and an internet connection in seconds. This makes Peer-to-Peer transactions super-fast, free and confidential. 11. Since CloudCoins use simple integers, like paper money, the values are easy to understand. 12. CloudCoins are limited. Only a fixed amount have been minted and no more will ever be added. This eliminates the possibility of inflation. Your money will not lose value because some government or entity creates more in order to manipulate the economy. 13. CloudCoins cannot be taken from your account by anyone. 14. The money in you CloudCoin account is not visible. 15. Your account cannot be frozen. 16. CloudCoins cannot be copied or double spent. This is because with each transaction the authentication code is changed and the ownership is transferred to the receiver. 17. CloudCoins cannot be permanently lost. Procedures are in place that can immediately find lost coins, but if for some reason the coins are lost without having copies of the serial numbers, there still exists a way that lost coins can be recovered after two years. It is the first digital currency that can be found if lost. 18. The CloudCoin RAIDA system is completely scalable. Because of its small file sizes, very small electrical requirements, and the small size of the computers necessary, the system can be expanded indefinitely while remaining financially and ecologically viable. It has the capability of serving a global economy. THE PURPOSE OF CloudCoin. The purpose of having a currency like CloudCoin is simply to enhance free trade.We believe that trade is simultaneously; (a) the glue that binds peoples and nations together, and (b) the lubricant that smooths out the frictions born out of the differences between them. Where free trade prospers, wars cease. Free trade acknowledges and rewards true value. It‚Äôs independent and outside of beliefs or political ideologies. We therefore hold that the basic purpose of a true currency is simply, and only, its ability to quickly, safely and easily facilitate free trade anywhere in the world. WHY RAIDA AND CLOUDCOIN? THE PROBLEM The person or persons known as ‚ÄúSatoshi Nakamoto‚Äù introduced a revolutionary advancement affecting technology, finance, sociology and other fields with the advent of distributed ledger technology in 2008. Nakamoto was the first to solve what computer scientists call ‚Äòthe physical integrity problem‚Äô, allowing for the creation of the first widely-accepted digital currencies that could not be copied or double-spent. That was over a decade ago. For over a decade, distributed ledger technology (DLT, also known as blockchain) has promised to provide solutions for every problem from currency inflation to world hunger to global warming. The hype has not been the reality. Blockchain technology has been hampered by the inability to efficiently scale, unreasonable transactional times, and overly complex and dangerous consensus paradigms. Blockchain applications are immensely harmful to the environment, consuming more electricity each day than used by most nations. There has been progress in the application of distributed ledger technology, but improvements have not come close to solving its fundamental weaknesses. DLT has failed to deliver on its promise to become a transformative innovation. Continuous advances in quantum computing, meanwhile, threaten to completely nullify the centerpiece of DLT: asymmetric elliptic curve cryptography. The Quantum Era is near, if not already upon us, as many experts believe. Quantum computers rely on quantum mechanical phenomena like entanglement and superposition to operate on quantum bits of data (qubits). Traditional bits are binary: they are either ones or they are zeros. Qubits, essentially, can be ones, zeros or both at the same time. A quantum computer is able to process data twenty million or more times faster than a traditional one. The simple reality is that by the time DLT/blockchain technology reaches anything near critical mass, it will already be obsolete! The next generation of technology to provide immersive customer engagement, shield data transmission, stop counterfeiting, ensure privacy, safeguard financial security and protect intellectual property will be effective only if it is quantum-safe and provides solutions to blockchain‚Äôs problems with scalability, speed, privacy efficiency, governance and ecological harm. NOW CloudCoin‚Ñ¢ is in the process of finalizing its new ‚ÄúClient Wallet‚Äù and will be inviting a limited number of public to take part in the second stage of Beta Testing. No technical knowledge is required. As mentioned above, the wallet is only about 5 MG in size and downloads quickly. People participating in the Beta Test will be provided with CloudCoins to use during the testing, and upon completion will be rewarded for participating.If you are interested in participating, and possibly be part of building a new world, contact the person who sent you this and ask to be added to the list of beta-testers. ‚ÄúCloudCoin Wallet.‚Äù This program will change many things and make CloudCoin much more usable. CloudCoin Wallet can automatically make change and it can send CloudCoins from one person to another with a click of a button. Its transfer time maybe the fastest of any payment system in the world. We are able to send coins to the change maker, and get them back within four seconds. This means that a user can send the two transactions of sending money, making sure it is authentic, sending change and making sure that is authentic (two transactions) happen in less time than it takes to approve a Visa payment. People get to have their own username. In a few days we will have Merchant software that allows anyone to accept CloudCoins as payment. The exchange is well underway. We will focus all effort on Liquidity and it will be a fast effort. CloudCoin Wallet, has been released to the public and can be found at: https://cloudcoinconsortium.com/use.html The Consortium expect to have the final version done within few weeks. The new Wallet can fix 400 fracked coins at a time instead of one at a time, track your deposits and transfers. The Wallet allow you to encrypt your coins, allow you to embed email hash for recovering lost coins by email. It can fix coins in the case that they RAIDA does not answer, It can also all you to keep your coins in the Cloud and transfer them to another person instantly without using email or other forms of file transfer. The new version also comes in a high contrast version.The final version will have the ability to process 1000 coins at one time instead of 400, will be able to transfer from one Skywallet account to another, will have multi fix and hopefully can recover lost coins by email. It will also fix any bugs that we find in the Beta version. Lastly, I hope to include a way for a user to get one free CloudCoin if they sign up for out news letter. This will help them create a Skywallet to receive CloudCoins. CloudCoin Consortium states that they are officially in the Liquidity phase. This is when they works to make it so their coin to be changed into goods, services and other currencies very quickly. Projects include own P2P Exchange, The Escrowed Exchange, The Craigs-List type Store, the Merchant software, APIs and Video games. The Peer To Peer Exchange. The backend and front-end business layer are 95% done. The GUI for the P2P exchange is 50% done. Then payments systems will be added. An P2P exchange ready for testing in just a few weeks. The Merchant Software: Creates a ‚ÄúPay With CloudCoin‚Äù button. It is completed and now in testing‚Ä¶.

Computer vision is a branch of computer science which deals with the processing of the images. We see Computer vision all around us in every walk of the life and no one in modern age can expect a life full of joys and ease without the presence of computer vision and its applications. Imagine the world without computer vision now, imagine you don‚Äôt have access to any cameras and you can‚Äôt watch your favorite movies and drams any more. Imagine the world without playing games and taking selfies on your cameras? Well this is the power of Computer vision. Now let's talk about the main topic which is the image Fusion, basically we talked all about computer vision just to make the mind of our audience to know the importance of Image Fusion in the field of image processing. Image Fusion is a sub branch of Computer vision in which we fuse multiple images and make a single image which possess more rich and enhanced details of the image which we have fused. This is the best thing which we can do to increase the productivity of the images that we have captured from multiple sensors at different levels of exposure and luminance. The concept of Image fusion is very clear, we will have to enhance the particular amount of images and fuse them into a single image. Now lets talk about the different types of image Fusion which we can achieve. This type of image fusion is achieved by Fusing Multiple images of the same scene but present at different focuses, the multi focus image fusion is a type of image fusion which is most widely used in the image processing industry, in this type of image fusion we take multiple images which are taken at different focuses. The multi Focused images are then Fused by using different kind of algorithms which may involve weight maps and spatial frequency techniques. The practical implementations of multi focus image fusion techniques are in mobile phone cameras and also in Aero Research where researchers take multiple images of multi focus objects and fuse them using multi focus image fusion techniques. The next major image fusion technique which we apply is the Multi Sensor image fusion, the multi focus image fusion involves fusing multiple images taken from the different sensors(Cameras) and fusing them in a way that they compose a single resultant image. The sensors may be different like we may use a camera of Sony and the second one of Canon to capture an image of the same scene, the image fusion will collect all the images taken by the multiple sensors and fuse them into one image by using the image fusion Algorithm. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*S_RSYz6Qhh_Z8xvx.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*S_RSYz6Qhh_Z8xvx.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*S_RSYz6Qhh_Z8xvx.jpg"
https://medium.com/@xceptioncode/abusing-faceid-augmentation-feature-to-circumvent-apple-faceid-security-6b5a6b854f75?source=tag_archive---------119-----------------------,Abusing FaceID augmentation feature to circumvent Apple FaceID security,Written by Shubham Raj,Shubham Raj,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shubham Raj Follow -- Listen Share Security concern doesn‚Äôt need to always arise from a technical ground, well, very often ‚Äî you can abuse logic and business functionalities for the gain. Earlier this year, I noticed an interesting security concern with Apple Face ID which allows a non-enrolled user to unlock the iPhone X (including other products which support Face ID) using their face, even though their face is not set up for Face ID on that phone. This abuses a functional feature of Face ID known as Face ID augmentation which as described by Apple is to improve unlock performance and keep pace with the natural changes of your face and look. Tested Product, OS, & Settings:The test was conducted on iPhone X (IOS 12.1.4 ‚Äî most updated version at the time of testing) having a single Face ID setup without any alternate appearance settings and ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù for ‚ÄòRequire Attention for Face ID‚Äô which claims to provide additional security. Consider two users named owner and non-owner.  ‚Äî Owner‚Äôs face is enrolled/setup for FaceID on the phone and should be able to unlock the device using his face. ‚Äî Non-owner‚Äôs face is not enrolled/setup for FaceID on the same phone and should not be able to unlock the device using his face. Steps:1. Non-owner tries to unlock the device using his face and fails, which is then followed by the owner entering the correct passcode or non-owner entering the correct passcode (i.e., non-owner knows the correct passcode of the owner) to unlock the phone. 2. This continues for several times (~25‚Äì30*) periodically in both day-light and the low-light environment ‚Äî between which the owner can continue using the phone or unlocking the device using his face. 3. The iPhone after a while will start accepting both non-owner and owner face now as valid. And both of them would be able to unlock the device using their face. Note: The phone still only have owner‚Äôs face enrolled. Therefore, after ensuring the behavior was not previously reported (e.g., on blogs, news, forums, etc) and extended testing for some times, this was reported to Apple at the end of February 2019 with a POC video. *Number of times required would differ from person to person (based on facial features, etc). As read in Face ID security guide ‚ÄúTo improve unlock performance and keep pace with the natural changes of your face and look, Face ID augments its stored mathematical representation over time.‚Äù [1] For this post, we are particularly interested in this section of How Face ID unlocks an iOS device: If Face ID fails to recognize you, but the match quality is higher than a certain threshold and you immediately follow the failure by entering your passcode, Face ID takes another capture and augments its enrolled Face ID data with the newly calculated mathematical representation. Though, the guide mentions that the system is only augmented if the match quality is higher than a certain threshold, but, during our testing ‚Äî I perceive the lack of proper enforcement or possibility to bypass with repetition given the facial features/shape of the owner and non-owner‚Äôs face are significantly different (Fig 2, at the time of testing). The major problem here is the ineffectiveness of the system to distinguish between two completely different faces. More precisely, if the system keeps repetitively trained for a new face (i.e., following the failure to unlock a device using non-owner face by entering correct passcode) for several times, the system is unable to distinguish between non-owner and owner‚Äôs faces and hence poses a significant security risk.

In politics, the concepts are relatively easy to spot, especially during times of revolution. In society, it wasn‚Äôt until the Internet became accessible by many, that democratized information-enabled people became aware of the opportunities outside of a centralized, command and control hierarchy. The 1999 United Nations Development Programme working paper entitled ‚ÄòDecentralization: A Sampling of Definitions‚Äô, analyzed the significance of this. The paper concludes that ‚Äúthe movement toward local accountability and greater control over one‚Äôs destiny‚Äù is ‚Äúprincipally being driven by a strong desire for greater participation of citizens‚Äù. A Level Playing Field for All In and around the early 2000s, sharing economy models emerged, based on systems of trust, open-source data, and crowdfunding. These models enabled each component to freely operate within structures and provide a more level playing field where static hierarchies were less effective. The Internet has facilitated these and other innovations due to its ability to enable decentralization. Blockchain technology is such an innovation, but there is often confusion over what its true utility is and some misunderstanding as to its decentralized nature. Blockchains Ability to Create Resilience Through Decentralisation The most current accepted thinking is that Blockchains, despite being logically centralized in terms of a common framework that links everything together, are politically decentralized (because nobody is in complete control) and architecturally decentralized (because there isn‚Äôt a central failure point). This provides several benefits such as fault tolerance (due to the reliance on many components), attack resistance (due to the lack of central points of failure), and collusion resistance (due to the low or no ability for actors to collude towards selfish goals). The Application of Decentralisation Determines its Efficiency Critics of decentralization argue that the potential downsides of decentralisation include the risk of duplication of work, lack of singular focus, and low speed of action. However, those downsides depend on the context of decentralization. If the context is, for example, making a consensus decision, then indeed, it is more efficient for only one person or small team to form an opinion and for others to follow. Conversely, if the context is a transactional network where each individual actor can make their own decisions, the downside risk of inefficiency is removed. In other words, the way decentralization is applied, determines the value that can be created. Realizing the True Potential of Decentralisation The objective determines the outcome, therefore the biggest downside of decentralization is when the original objective intentionally (or unintentionally) allows the network to be rigged or gamed. The fastest way to damage a decentralized network is to add an element of centralization (such as greed or collusion) to how it operates. The best opportunities, however, come from a pure and holistically beneficial objective in the architectural design of a decentralized network. Only then will the true power of decentralization be realized.

ETFs are similar to individual stocks and trade on exchanges in the same manner.[1] The main aspect that complicates gold ETFs more than traditional stocks is the derivative underlying the investment. A derivative is a ‚Äúcontract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset.‚Äù An example of an underlying asset would be a security or commodity.[2] Gold ETFs hold gold derivative contracts that are backed by gold. So when someone invests in a gold ETF, they don‚Äôt actually own any of the gold, instead they are purchasing a share that represents the physical gold. In addition, most ETFs, upon redemption, do not pay out by providing the precious metal; they instead provide an investor with a cash equivalent. The goal of an ETF is to give an investor exposure to the price movements and/or performance of gold. Examples of Gold ETFs and How Redemption Works GLD ‚Äî SPDR Gold Trust ETF This is the world‚Äôs largest gold ETF.

How do you define real? If you‚Äôre talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, taste, and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.‚Äù ‚Äî Morpheus, The Matrix ‚ÄúTo deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.‚Äù ‚Äî Guy who programmed the woman in the red dress, The Matrix We live in exciting but trying times. While technology has driven incredible advances in nearly every field of human knowledge and dramatically improved our access to information and increased our standards of living, it has also forever changed the way we think, move, and communicate; and it is fundamentally redefining every aspect of human ethics and morality with each passing second. We need a new paradigm for living our lives. In many ways, the perpetual conundrums of human nature have just assumed new form. In other cases, totally new problems have emerged from the nascent technological ethos. I intend to use this forum to address the modern human experience. By asking the tough questions and seeking out answers from every perspective, we will dive into human nature in the 21st century and assess how to live a rational, sustainable, healthy life by navigating the ever-expanding web of technology and consciousness. Climate change, mass surveillance, fake information, thinking machines, cybernetics, and data-driven decision making‚Ä¶ no stone will be left unturned in this investigation of the intersection of technology and philosophy. Join me on a journey into the future of mindfulness, a journey into the essence of invention, a journey that will reveal the nature of our souls. To create a better world, we must first learn how to create our best selves. Together we will make it so. A little bit about me- I believe in critical thinking. I believe in applying the scientific method; I feel that by using meticulous, analytical evaluation, we can reach logical conclusions that will lead to rational, sustainable solutions to problems. I believe that every person has their own inherent biases, but that by trying to understand and overcome these biases, we can eliminate prejudice, discrimination, and injustice in order to create an egalitarian society. Most importantly, I believe that knowledge lives, breathes, and evolves through informed conversation. I encourage the testing and challenging of my ideas. I know I am constantly questioning and challenging my own. I am a developer, a writer, a maker, and a concerned citizen that wants to use his skills and knowledge to make the world a better place so that our grandkids‚Äô grandkids will have the opportunity to continue explore this wonderful universe. This blog will delve into the esoteric aspects of technology, the unspoken effects that it has on our lives, brains, and spirits. Even though most of human philosophy thus far was born in a reality without this technology, many of its essential pillars can be applied to the new cyberverse we‚Äôve created to improve the way we interact with computers, phones, and each other. By looking to the past, we can prepare a better future. We are the first generation to ever have the tools we have at our disposal. We are still learning the best ways to use them. Sometimes the thoughts we have about why we‚Äôre doing something, how we might improve some seemingly innocuous routine or process, or why we might feel strange about something just flickers through in our brains for a split second and disappears like a bug. I hope this series will be a debugging exercise for all who read it. I hope I can offer some insight into how we can use ethics to leverage technology for the greater good of ourselves and society. And I hope you will be entertained. More than anything, I want this exercise to also be a conversation.

Is IoT something to be scared of? When someone refers to the Internet of Things (IoT), it means billions of physical devices present all around the world which are connected online, for sharing and collecting data. As there are various wireless networks and cheap processors, it is easy to turn anything from a small microchip to an airplane, making it a part of the IoT. Frankly, this will add a certain level of digital intelligence to devices which otherwise would be dumb, allowing them to communicate without having any human involvement, and merging the physical and digital worlds. Let‚Äôs think of the IoT scenario as a computer that knows everything it needs to be aware of, by utilizing data that they have gathered without taking any help from humans. So, here one can track and count all the things, thereby reducing loss, wastage and even cost. In addition, we can know when things have to be repaired, replaced or recalled, and if they are past their best or fresh. People assume IoT as being connected to tablets, smartphones, and computers. IoT defines a world where each and everything can be communicated and connected in an easy manner or intelligent fashion. So, in other words, with IoT, the physical world becomes one huge information system. Relationship of IoT and Devices The kind of relationship devices and IoT have can be summed up as ‚Äî any physical object can be converted into loT devices if they are connected to the Internet and easily controlled. For example, a lightbulb switched on by using a smartphone app is an IoT device. In the same way, a smart thermostat in your home or motion sensor or a connected streetlight in your community are the examples of IoT devices. ‚ÄúAn IoT device can be as soft as a kid‚Äôs toy or as serious as a driverless school bus or as complicated as a jet engine which is filled with hundreds of sensors that transmit and collect data back, for making sure the operation is efficient.‚Äù On a bigger scale, smart cities projects are filling various regions with sensors that assist in understanding and controlling the environment. Sometimes you can relate IoT to devices which don‚Äôt have an internet connection and communicates with various networks independently without any human action. So, for this reason, you can‚Äôt consider a PC as an IoT device and the same is the case with smartphones irrespective of whether it is crammed with sensors. But you can consider a fitness band or smartwatch or any other kind of wearable device as an IoT device. Role IoT can play in 2019 There are certain distinct roles that IoT can play in 2019 and the coming years. Some of them are - ‚ñ† IoT Architecture & Platform Cloud-related IoT architecture and platform will connect the virtual and real world. Also, these will assist companies to manage the IoT device security and connectivity and even collect device data, ensure IoT interoperability, and create as well as run the IoT applications. ‚ñ† Harness IoT Data Explosion Smart devices will generate a huge amount of IoT data, and this will need to be leveraged and analyzed in real time. Here is where Big Data and predictive analytics come into the picture. In addition, machine learning will be utilized for adding basic context to the data and trigger actions without the intervention of humans. ‚ñ† Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) And M2M In the manufacturing sector, there is a slight possibility that the IoT will become the IIoT (which is nothing but an Industrial Internet of Things) and this is also called as Industrial Internet. In the IIoT, machine to machine (M2M) technology will be used for supporting each and everything right from telemetry and remote monitoring to predictive maintenance. IoT ‚Äî Emerging Tech Since the prices of sensors and communication will drastically drop, it will be cost-effective to bring in more devices into the IoT. And in some cases, it will be beneficial to consumers too. With the increase in the number of connected devices, our working and living environment will be filled with various smart products, if we are really willing to take into account privacy and security trade-offs. There are chances that some might welcome the new era of smart things while others might pine for days when the table was just a normal table. -- -- Founder of a 2Base Technologies Pvt Ltd(Web and Mobile App Development Company).

No inicio de tudo √©ramos uma esp√©cie de homin√≠deos com o andar ‚Äúcorcunda‚Äù, uma comunica√ß√£o abomin√°vel e viv√≠amos em um mundo praticamente ‚Äúcru‚Äù. Ao decorrer dos s√©culos as coisas foram mudando, o ser humano foi evoluindo e demonstrando o porqu√™ de ser uma esp√©cie homo sapiens. Muitos seres humanos usaram sua criatividade e intelig√™ncia para criar coisas e facilitar nosso habitat, criaram os carros, avi√µes, energia el√©trica e uma infinidade de coisas extremamente importantes para a vida humana, ou seja, foram facilitando nossa vivencia ao longo dos anos. As duas guerras mundiais nos mostraram o quanto quer√≠amos e precis√°vamos de tecnologia, talvez voc√™ esteja pensando: ‚Äúmas tecnologia para matar?‚Äù Sim, foi preciso na √©poca, era uma luta por posses onde a morte gerava riqueza e a tecnologia ajudava no ataque e na defesa, logo ap√≥s a segunda guerra mundial surgiu √† corrida armamentista (Guerra Fria) onde os EUA e a URSS disputava acirradamente quem era mais desenvolvido em quest√£o tecnol√≥gica, isso acarretou muito desenvolvimento, mas tamb√©m houve in√∫meras fatalidades como (Chernobyl e Pripyat/ abril-1986). Criamos foguetes e a URSS mandou um animal para a Lua, os EUA em forma ret√≥rica mandou o homem, tivemos assim uma evolu√ß√£o ou talvez at√© uma revolu√ß√£o tecnol√≥gica espl√™ndida, tudo foi at√© a queda do muro de Berlin em 1989, onde ocorreu a ruptura na divis√£o da Alemanha capitalista (ocidental) com a socialista (oriental). No dia 1¬∫ de Janeiro de 2001 iniciamos o s√©culo XXI, junto veio √† internet, agora mais desenvolvida em rela√ß√£o a d√©cada de 1960. Essa gera√ß√£o apareceu com alguns aparelhos eletr√¥nicos da √©poca, tais como: celulares b√°sicos, videogames, computadores, eletr√¥nicos musicais e c√¢meras fotogr√°ficas ainda mais desenvolvidas. Nessa ocasi√£o para o ser humano usufruir de toda essa tecnologia era preciso adquirir todas de forma separada, ou seja, era muito incomum ter todos esses aparelhos, at√© porque o modo de divers√£o era outro muito mais simples, isso era apenas luxo. O problema/ solu√ß√£o come√ßou aparecer alguns anos mais tarde, quando a Apple em 2007 lan√ßou seu primeiro Smartphone que combinava tudo citado acima dentro de um √∫nico aparelho tang√≠vel. Vivenciando os dias atuais o ser humano n√£o consegue mais suprir suas necessidades di√°rias sem tecnologia, tudo ficou mais f√°cil, mais pr√°tico, mais lucrativo e mais superficial. Nossas crian√ßas est√£o extremamente proativas quando o assunto √© tecnologia, mas at√© que ponto isso √© bom para o desenvolvimento humano? O ego que enfatizamos por conta das redes sociais nos fazem sentir a ilus√£o de estarmos mais pr√≥ximos das pessoas, quando na verdade estamos mais longes. N√£o existe mais conquista carnal entre seres, eles n√£o sabem se comunicar pessoalmente. Antes do s√©culo XXI existia o ser humano racional e sentimental, ap√≥s o inicio do s√©culo XXI existe o ser humano racional e digital. O brasileiro passa cerca de 9 horas por dia online, seja por, celulares, tabletes e computadores, estamos em terceiro lugar no ranking dos pa√≠ses que mais ficam conectados, s√≥ nos encontramos atr√°s da Tail√¢ndia e da Filipinas. Com base √†s informa√ß√µes acima, podemos afirmar que o maior prejudicado com toda essa evolu√ß√£o tecnol√≥gica √© o corpo humano, o ser humano excede o tempo em que for√ßa partes do corpo para suprir suas necessidades digitais, o maior exemplo disso √© a coluna, passamos cerca de 4 horas usando o celular com o pesco√ßo dobrado para baixo, isso pode desencadear s√©rias les√µes cervicais. Outra parte do dia passamos sentados em cadeiras, cujo, ajuste nunca est√° de acordo com sua propor√ß√£o corporal, o que ocasionar√° les√µes na coluna vertebral e at√© mesmo na regi√£o lombar. Ilumina√ß√£o excessiva, causar√° problemas futuros de vista e fones de ouvidos n√£o utiliz√°veis na altura recomendada, que ocasionar√° perda auditiva. O pr√≥prio uso do celular em excesso est√° relacionado √† ansiedade, depress√£o e problemas do sono. As empresas de tecnologia, estudando os riscos, j√° se preparam para os pr√≥ximos anos com uma proposta de fabricar aparelhos, nos quais, ficar√£o presos a nossos membros superiores, est√° sendo estudada uma esp√©cie de √≥culos que n√£o contenha excesso de ilumina√ß√£o. Na futura ocasi√£o os dois v√™m para substituir o uso do aparelho celular, ou seja, tudo indica que estamos dando fim √† era celular. Um levantamento feito pela Itmidia concluiu que as doen√ßas do futuro relacionadas √† tecnologia ser√£o: depress√£o, problemas na coluna, perda auditiva, dem√™ncia, problemas de vista e ins√¥nia. Relacionando hist√≥ria, tecnologia e ergonomia, tudo segmenta a quest√£o de que a evolu√ß√£o nos levar√° a um retrocesso ao Arcaico, pelos seguintes motivos : o digital est√° cobrindo o som da voz, por quest√µes ergon√¥micas poderemos voltar a ser fisicamente igual aos homin√≠deos, e por consequ√™ncia social viveremos a ilus√£o da alegoria da caverna. A era digital tende a evoluir, e n√≥s seres humanos, temos que acompanhar a evolu√ß√£o, pois, o mundo econ√¥mico gira entorno disso, n√£o podemos mudar nossos padr√µes corporais para acompanhar a intera√ß√£o digital, mas podemos sim, nos regrarmos e reeducarmos em quest√µes ergon√¥micas para n√£o sofrermos do mal causado pela tecnologia contempor√¢nea. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*SM0Af6zatKEjEE9h, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*SM0Af6zatKEjEE9h, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*SM0Af6zatKEjEE9h"
https://medium.com/@nickroot/10-years-from-now-3001b2ba8bde?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,10 years from now,Written by Nick Root,Nick Root,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nick Root Follow -- 1 Listen Share My name is Dietmar and I am an entrepreneur in the year 2030. I run a fleet of autonomous taxis in Zurich, through a business called Fast Cabs. A lot has changed in the last decade, so I hope what you are about to read helps you understand the financial systems that are required to facilitate the businesses of tomorrow. I incorporated the business entirely on a Swiss government issued blockchain. My partners and I hold shares in the form of smart contracts, with built in voting rights and share issuance functionality. All shares on the Swiss stock market are now smart contracts. The only distinguishing factor making a company public (or not) is a Boolean database field called ‚ÄòPUBLIC_TRADABLE‚Äô. We are keeping ours to ‚ÄòFALSE‚Äô for now. It‚Äôs not that we are worried about the extra paperwork, in fact there is no paperwork in 2030, now that all our transactions are automatically classified by our bank‚Äôs AI and booked via API into the correct accounting fields. We currently run 30 driverless taxis as part of the city‚Äôs privatised transportation scheme. We funded 10 ourselves and lease the other 20. The leaser gets paid in real time based on a 50% split of all revenue made on those taxis. This is easy to do because each taxi has its own digital identity, wallet and corresponding wallet logic. The leaser therefore doesn‚Äôt need to trust us to pay on time or to pay the correct amount. Not that trust is really a problem anymore. After a series of high-profile fraud and corruption cases in the early 2020s, companies can now not be successful unless they build ‚Äòtrust by design‚Äô. It‚Äôs the first thing investors and lenders ask about. Let me give you an example of what I mean. All my company‚Äôs ‚Äòevents‚Äô are added to a Merkle Tree made up of quantum-resistant hash functions. Events can be financial transactions, accounting adjustments, taxi rides, recharges or maintenance trips. Our last audit took a nerve racking 30 seconds, which is the time it took for our auditors‚Äô algorithm to remotely check that our financial database balanced and that our corresponding event blockchain was valid. Financial audit algorithms are not the only algos we have to accommodate. The tech businesses of your era were borderless and became more powerful than most countries. They took full advantage of Western governments‚Äô haplessness, lobbying against increased anti-trust and social media responsibility and happily paying whatever regulatory fines were imposed against them. That all came to an end in the early 20‚Äôs, when regulators finally showed their teeth, imposing personal liability on tech executives for regulatory breaches and ordering the break-up of several tech giants, which were forced to sell off sections of their business to stimulate market competition. The authorities also now have a real time ‚Äòevent feed‚Äô that monitors our management systems. They have detection algorithms running for price manipulation, monopoly behaviour and any kind of foul play. It might sound a bit big brother I know, but it‚Äôs not all bad: tax returns are now a thing of the past, for example. Talking of tax, in the mid 2020s companies are viewed as social entities that need to support their people as much as they need to support their customers. Our tax rate is a function of the salary range between our lowest and highest earners. So if a company pays their CEO five hundred times as much as their lowest earning employee, they get hit with a very high tax rate to compensate the state for needing to care more for these low earners. It‚Äôs not just audits, tax and regulation that have sped up. The whole business runs at a pace that completely excludes humans from operational roles. Humans are just not fast enough in this world. We run the algorithms which in turn run the business. I‚Äôll explain what I mean. When a customer needs a ride, they use an aggregator app on their smartphone to post a lift request, including the details of the trip required. All licenced taxis in the area receive the request and prepare a quote. The quote is dependent not only on the distance and time required for the trip, but also the potential routes. In 2030 the roads have become economic players themselves, with wallets and their own price optimisation algorithms that price according to the traffic situation and road condition. The cab needs to take all this into account and quote the potential passenger a reasonable price in less than 3 seconds. The passenger has a choice of several leading aggregator apps, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter which one they use. What matters is the algorithm they choose to run within their app. Algorithms or ‚Äòalgos‚Äô as we call them, are now independent products just like apps of your day. Most apps are free but it‚Äôs the algos that people buy from independent stores to help them filter through the enormous amount of data they are now exposed to. All products: visual content, music, restaurants and of course taxis are filtered for humans by recommender algos. Taxi hailing algos can order by price, speed, customer review rating or perhaps a combination of everything. A taxi‚Äôs customer rating is particularly important for customers as they seek a safe, high quality ride. The most common method is to give heavier weighting to reviews from a customer‚Äôs friend or acquaintance. These ‚Äòweighted ratings‚Äô are possible because in 2030 all bots and people have digital identities, known as a ‚Äòseed‚Äô. These are government issued IDs that use cryptography to disclose only the things about you that you want known. For example, the app can query any of my taxis‚Äô public fields, like ‚ÄòLICENCE_NO‚Äô so they can cross check it to the official licence register, or ‚ÄòREG_NUMBER‚Äô to cross check with all friends‚Äô taxi histories and ratings. Right now, human drivers are making a comeback despite the reduced product quality, a little like the vinyl revival of your time. To facilitate this, hipsters would need to make sure that ‚ÄòIS_HUMAN‚Äô returns ‚ÄòTRUE‚Äô on the taxi‚Äôs ID. Once the passenger has chosen the taxi and is on their way, the taxi starts making continuous micro payments with various route wallets as it goes. It also continually communicates with the routes ahead. If the traffic situation changes, an alternative route is negotiated with the various economic players involved, not least the passenger, who will need to be notified. Cash is a distant memory in 2030, and so are cards. As soon as bank payments became instant there was no need for Visa or Mastercard to act as middlemen. The customer‚Äôs app initiates a wire straight from the customer‚Äôs wallet to the taxi wallet when the trip is complete. The problem of fraud and chargebacks was solved with ‚Äòfraud ratings‚Äô, facilitated by the above-mentioned digital identities. All economic actors, including the bots, are held to account using these ratings, so if you are about to wire money to a wallet with a shady history, the system will warn you up front. This strongly incentivises fair resolution of financial issues, just like Ebay in your time, who were the pioneers of this trust system. When the customer is in the cab, they can pick up whatever audio or visual content they feel like for the journey. As soon as they enter the cab, our smart screens detect their current subscriptions and automatically log them back into whatever VR filmscape they were last watching. The advertising in my cab uses smart screens that display targeted ads according to the customer‚Äôs purchasing profile, which is communicated to the cab from the customer‚Äôs personal device just like their content subscriptions. The screens can tell when a customer‚Äôs eyeballs actually look at the screen, just like impressions in old-school web advertising, so the advertiser fires us a real-time micropayment to my wallet every time a customer looks at the ad. My taxis are finished with solar paint and glass, so they are permanently recharging. However, when it‚Äôs a cloudy day they use more electricity than they can create. When their batteries are low, they automatically hook up to the city‚Äôs smart grid for a recharge. When plugged in and recharged they can even use their panels to contribute back to the grid. The grid is now ‚Äòsmart‚Äô which means traceability can be recorded using a public power blockchain to prove the amount of power used and produced. The wallets of the taxi and local charging units are debited or credited according to who powered whom. So as you can see, by 2030 some things have changed a lot and others not so much. People still need to run businesses and, thankfully for my business, people still need to hail taxis. It‚Äôs the methods and systems that facilitate those endeavours that have changed most. This facilitation has been enabled by infrastructure that enables complex interactions at huge scale. Just a simple taxi ride has involved thousands of actors collaborating and often competing at breath-taking speed using common web protocols. The World Wide Web is finally worthy of its name. -- -- 1 Enthusiast www.nickroot.co.uk Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*02GOYKH9qBGwXhhc2Uj6Gg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*02GOYKH9qBGwXhhc2Uj6Gg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*02GOYKH9qBGwXhhc2Uj6Gg.jpeg"

Currently, I am based in San Francisco, CA. In July 2017, I began my MBA journey at Simon Business School in Rochester, NY. I spent the three years prior in Burkina Faso, West Africa as a Peace Corps Volunteer. Those three years had a tremendous impact on my life and there‚Äôs not a day that goes by when I don‚Äôt think of my friends and family back in my village. Therefore, when I was enrolled in my Advanced Competitive Strategy course and a Bangladeshi classmate asked me if I wanted to spend the semester learning about a new app that would help individuals in emerging markets get jobs, I gave an immediate ‚Äúyes!‚Äù. Three classmates and I spent the Spring semester analyzing Kormo‚Äôs business value proposition and recommending a long-term strategy. For those unfamiliar with the app, Kormo was launched out of Google‚Äôs in-house incubator, Google 120. The idea was born after founder Bickey Russell saw firsthand the consequences of the unstructured job hiring process in Bangladesh. Kormo‚Äôs services target job seekers and employers operating within Bangladesh‚Äôs informal, gig economy and aim to improve the speed, quality, and experience of applicant-employer matching. My team and I spent a good portion of the semester familiarizing ourselves with the Bangladeshi job market. We kept our focus on the employers in Bangladesh and wanted to analyze the problems they currently face, hypothesized reasons for why these problems exist today, and identified what an ideal solution for hiring an applicant would look like. From here, we analyzed what Kormo is currently doing and made recommendations based on discrepancies between the two. After a semester-long research and analysis, we categorized the problems job-seekers in Bangladesh‚Äôs gig economy into the following three: 1. Small-and-medium businesses often have a limited applicant pool 2. Employees face uncertainty in applicants‚Äô accountability 3. Risk of unreliable employee once hired Here, I will take you through problem 2- the problem of uncertainty in applicant accountability. In doing our research, we discovered that a major problem employers face is that employees often don‚Äôt show up for interviews. My American teammates and I were in absolute shock to learn this. We couldn‚Äôt believe that interviewees in Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh and where Kormo was initially launched) would land an interview then not show up! According to a Kaizen market research report, professionalism is a top quality employers look for in candidates so it seemed like identifying to root reason as to why applicants aren‚Äôt showing up to interviews would help improve the job-matching process. We identified the following three hypotheses as to why applicants may not be showing up for interviews: unenforceable attendance, limited contact capability, and poor planning by candidates. Unenforceable Attendance: Our first hypothesized reason as to why candidates are not showing up to interviews is that candidates see attendance as unenforceable with no repercussions for not showing up. Applicants may perceive jobs within the informal job market as undifferentiated and thus have little motivation for showing up, especially if there is no substantial consequence for unexcused absences. Therefore, Kormo could track candidates interview attendance rate and provide a warning notification of consequences, such as downgrading resume priority for future gigs, if the candidate drops below a certain level. Additionally, Kormo could also temporarily freeze accounts for unexcused absences to interviews. These could help increase the interview attendance rate of candidates. Limited Contact Capability: A second explanation as to why applicants aren‚Äôt showing up to interviews is that they may be limited in their capability of contacting their potential employer. If applicants are not provided with the employer‚Äôs direct contact information, then they may be at a loss when trying to cancel. Additionally, there may be unanticipated situations that may legitimately bar applicants from interviewing. For Kormo, this means that they could ensure in-app direct messaging capability between applicants and potential employers to prevent interview no-shows. By allowing instant messaging capability between candidates and employers and creating one-click functionality for 24+ hour cancellation without consequence could help decrease interview no-show rates. Poor Planning by Candidates: A final explanation as to why applicants aren‚Äôt showing up to interviews is poor planning by the candidates. They may be neglecting to check their schedule for upcoming events and conflicts before accepting interviews. Or, candidates may by overlooking a means of transportation for the interview or accounting for traffic. Kormo can leverage Google apps to help if this is the root cause of why interviews are not showing up for interviews. First, Kormo can leverage Google calendars by sending event reminders for upcoming interviews. Finally, Google maps could be integrated within Kormo to provide push notifications about departure time given projected traffic conditions. Travel and nudge notifications would be a way to potentially decrease interview no-show rates if the core reason is poor planning by the candidates themselves. We believe that improving the proportion of applicants who attend interviews would increase Kormo‚Äôs value.

But, on the other hand, a bear market often proves to be an opportune time for coins to develop, and grow, not only their community but their technological developments as well. Thus, here are the three coins to watch for February 2019. Zilliqa (ZIL) Being able to scale without sacrificing decentralization, is the primary objective for most cryptocurrencies. And for Zilliqa (ZIL), it‚Äôs the primary goal. Zilliqa is known as the high-throughput blockchain platform. It emerged from a growing need to scale. After watching scaling problems with existing blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, the Zilliqa team decided to develop a platform which worked to address the scaling issue. They use on chain sharding to enable many transactions to be processed on a smaller scale along the network. This resulted in Zilliqa being able to handle almost 3000 (approx 2828) transactions per second (TPS). One of the reasons Zilliqa is a coin to keep an eye on in February is due to its upcoming mainnet launch. Though this is technically on the 31st of January, the repercussions of such a significant release will be felt during the following month. The mainnet will launch with many novel features, such as a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) based blockchain. Byzantine fault tolerance is a type of consensus model which address the Byzantine generals problem, a universal issue experienced by all distributed networks. In short, inconsistencies, result in catastrophe. Innovative solutions, like pBFT, fight this issue by reducing the influence of malicious actors, or discrepancies on a distributed network. Moreover, PBFT adds finality, which means there is no need for confirmations and this creates a faster transaction. Another feature that will be implemented upon launch is safe, smart contracts. This will make use of Zilliqa‚Äôs self-developed programing language called Scilla. The language is not Turing complete, because of this it won‚Äôt support all applications, but since it‚Äôs ‚Äòincomplete‚Äô it means that it can be verified, validating smart contracts and making them ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù Furthermore, dual & eco-friendly mining will go live with the mainnet. For mining, Zilliqa uses a special combination of Proof of work (POW) and pBFT. Using POW for approximately 1 minute, every 2‚Äì3 of any given mining cycle results in less energy cost. The combination of these two consensus mechanisms also allows for dual mining of any Ethash-powered POW blockchain. ZIL sits at a current price of $0.020373 TRON (TRX) Tron is positioning itself to become a global digital content entertainment system, competing with platforms like Ethereum to gain supremacy over the decentralized application market and eventually become a world leader in digital entertainment consumption. Justin Sun is TRON‚Äôs CEO, and a powerfully loyal community backs the company, TRX has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the industry. Since the release of the Tron Virtual Machine (TVM), the company has gone from strength to strength citing a total of 142 Tron dapps, 6 of which are the top 10 dapps of all time. What‚Äôs more, the number of registered accounts continues to increase and currently stands at a whopping 1.42 million. Tron had a big year in 2018 with the launch of its mainnet, and the TVM, to the $140 million acquisition of peer to peer file sharing network BitTorrent, and the subsequent initiation of project Atlas. Sun claims that the purchase will eventually make Tron the ‚Äúlargest decentralized Internet ecosystem in the world.‚Äù The plan was to update BitTorrent for the crypto generation, tokenizing the platform through the sale of its token BTT. Tron benefitted from the migration of more than 100 million active of BitTorrent users over to Tron, and Vice versa. The project aims to incentivize file sharing on the BitTorrent platform through the integration of a new Tron based TRC-10 token BitTorrent (BTT). February will be a promising month for TRON, particularly with the recent BTT token sale. Using the rights to BitTorrent, Sun introduced a series of periodic airdrops of the newly minted BTT token for all TRX holders. The first of which will happen on February 11. The airdrop will be issued to any holder of TRX on a one to one ratio, i.e. for every TRX held, one BTT will be airdropped. A massive 10.1% of the current supply of the BTT token will be airdropped in varying degrees up until 2025. TRX sits at a current price of $0.027545 Binance Coin (BNB) BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the world‚Äôs leading crypto exchange Binance. BNB offered early funding for Binance via its distribution in the ICO back in July 2017. Based on the Ethereum network, BNB is an ERC-20 token, which is presently most widely used for paying fees on the exchange. BNB will most likely be implemented into the company‚Äôs upcoming public blockchain, Bianace chain. Announced back in March 2018, Binance Chain is as ambitious, as it is unprecedented, seeing the company acquire its own mainnet. Instead of running on the Ethereum network, BNB will function as a native token on its very own blockchain. Binance chain could launch in February, with the company pointing to initiation at some point in Q1. As per the firm, Binance chain will move from being a company to a community CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao aka CZ remarked that Binance Chain was both fast and less expensive than Ethereum. Zhao said that on Binance Chain users get one-second transaction confirmation and one confirmation is final, so it‚Äôs a much faster chain, and the transaction fees are less costly, there‚Äôs a lot of advantages for them to move to the Binance chain, which uses a native DEX. The exchange also has a highly anticipated decentralized exchange. Binance DEX is set to launch in early Q1 of this year with CZ announcing that he expected the DEX to be ready by late 2018/early 2019 (so every reason to watch out for it in Feb). The new exchange will boast a wallet where users can store any token they want to trade and will use BNB as a quasi ‚Äògas‚Äô for transactions. Being a decentralized exchange, the Binance DEX will provide a high level of security with data spread across multiple points. BNB sits at a current price of $6.11.

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-much-do-data-scientists-make-part-2-cb959a0d05f?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,How Much Do Data Scientists Make Part 2,Digging Deeper Reveals 2 Underlying Trends,Tony Yiu,No Author URL,N/A,Tony Yiu,"The world‚Äôs leading publication for data science, AI, and ML professionals. 
			We Find Some Surprising Trends When We Dig Deeper		 Last time we used H1B salary data to explore general data scientist salary trends (please refer to my previous blog post for details on the data). Here is a quick refresher of what we found: Last time I didn‚Äôt have enough time to dig more deeply into the numbers. But after examining things in more detail, I discovered some surprising trends. First, the general stagnation in Data Science salaries on average over the past few years is really a tale of 2 trends: I realize that my list of ""trendy"" tech companies is completely subjective ‚Äì my criteria was, ""Would the average grad of a top engineering school be excited to work there?"" Regardless, check out the difference in trends: My guess is that there are two groups of companies ‚Äì ones that have the ability to produce, gather, and extract competitive edge from proprietary data and ones that do not have it. Because the ""haves"" can get more value out of their data scientists, they are willing to pay them more as well. Meanwhile the ""have nots"" are much more likely to get frustrated with the lack of value created by their data science teams resulting in a lower perceived worth (and higher turnover). Companies like Google and Facebook have demonstrated that gathering and exploiting unique data can create a massive competitive advantage (and this competitive advantage expands over time as more data is collected and insights are gleaned). Their success with using data science to generate massive profits creates a virtuous feedback loop where data and research creates profits which are then reinvested back into more data and research (resulting in even greater future profits). So the lesson for aspiring data scientists is to work for a company that owns the type of unique data that grants a competitive edge. And a company that knows how to properly use that data to create a virtuous loop of research and profits. Here is a recent (2018‚Äì19) look at median data scientist salary by company. Remember, we are looking at only the data scientist job title and I filtered out companies that hired 5 or fewer data scientists during the period. Wow, look at Stitch Fix! That is a pretty penny especially when we remember that the $190,000 median figure represents just base salary and does not include bonuses or stock. More generally, the companies at the top are all data driven and either have massive amounts of proprietary data (AirBnB, Lyft, Facebook) or are building towards it through unique interactions with their users (Stitch Fix, Opendoor). Lastly, when looking at these differences across companies, it is helpful to remember that they are driven not just by the relative sizes of each company‚Äôs bank account but also by differences in role and required expertise. Unsurprisingly, data scientist pay in the San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley) is higher than in other parts of the country (many of the companies in my ""trendy"" tech group are located in Silicon Valley). The difference in median base salary shown in the chart below is probably understated as I focused primarily on the West Coast and other tech hubs ‚Äì many low cost cities in the Midwest and the South were left out of my analysis. The difference in salaries between data scientists working in Silicon Valley versus other regions looks pretty significant. But unfortunately, the differences in cost of living (driven by sky high home prices and rents) is even greater. Making big bucks is great but we need to remember that expenses matter just as much. If we make big bucks but then we end up paying even bigger bucks to Uncle Sam (taxes) and our landlord (rent), then we may still end up a net loser. First, let‚Äôs take a look at how data scientist salaries stack up by region (2018‚Äì19 salaries only): As expected, the San Francisco Bay Area comes out on top in terms of median base salary. New York salaries are less than I expected them to be ‚Äì the likely reason is that my dataset is not capturing some of the data scientists employed by the big banks (where they are probably called quantitative strategists, risk managers, or portfolio consultants). Also, using just base salary probably understates the earning power of data scientists employed by the big banks as their compensation is weighted heavily towards annual cash bonuses (100% bonuses are not out of the ordinary). The one that really jumps out to me is Seattle. As a data scientist there, you are earning almost as much as you would in Silicon Valley, but you pay no state income taxes and enjoy significantly lower housing costs. Let‚Äôs divide the median base salaries from the previous bar chart by median rents (multiplied by 12 to get annual rent) in each of those cities to get a rough proxy for how far your dollar goes (I left out the ""Other"" category as that includes multiple cities, but not enough to safely apply a national average). In case you are curious, here are the monthly median rents that I used (sourced from this article): And here are how the base salaries look when converted to units of rent-equivalents. Recall that I am taking the monthly rents and multiplying them by 12 in order to annualize them: Adjusted for rent, your data science salary goes a lot further in Seattle versus other tech hubs. And this is before we account for the fact that you pay lower taxes (no state income tax remember?) as well. So if you don‚Äôt mind the rain, consider dropping a resume or two with Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks. Finally, let‚Äôs check how the tech vs. no tech salary disparity looks across these regions (2018‚Äì19 salaries only). Seattle ""trendy"" tech companies on average pay more as well, just like the Bay Area (Silicon Valley). The disparity in New York is especially large ‚Äì my best guess is that non-tech NYC firms pay large annual bonuses, which would not show up in the H1B salary data. Before we call it a day, let‚Äôs recap some of the key findings from our data: Hopefully this was insightful and useful to you. Cheers!

As the number of sides of the polygons approach infinity and the length of their sides approach zero, your approximation gets closer. Archimedes (c. 287- 212) invented this early ‚Äòpolygonal algorithm‚Äô, which dominated for over 1000 years as the most efficient way of computing pi to any desired precision. The very primitive and geometric algorithmic function serves the purpose of estimating a real number, pi, whose value must be computed, as it is not expressible as a rational number (fraction/ratio). The modern study of computability began around 1900 with the announcement of Hilbert‚Äôs ‚Äòfinitist‚Äô program to axiomatize the foundations of mathematics. This after Hilbert himself had showed in 1899 that the consistency of geometry reduced to that of the real numbers, which in turn, reduced to the arithmetic results of Dedekind (Soare, 2013).

Nathan Matias,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in J. Nathan Matias Follow -- 1 Listen Share Remember these headlines? 2014 was the year that the digital media company Upworthy ‚Äúbroke the internet‚Äù in the words of cofounder Peter Koechley. By publishing positive, progressive news stories and optimizing them with A/B testing, Upworthy came to dominate online attention. What can we learn from all those A/B tests? Today, Good & Upworthy and our team of J. Nathan Matias (Cornell), Kevin Munger (Penn State), and Marianne Aubin Le Quere (Cornell) are announcing The Upworthy Research Archive, a dataset of 32,487 A/B tests conducted by Upworthy from January 2013 to April 2015. When released, we believe it will be the largest collection of randomized behavioral studies available for research and educational purposes. We believe Upworthy‚Äôs A/B tests can help us advance knowledge in many fields, including communication, political science, psychology, statistics, and computer science If you would like to do research with this dataset, we want to hear from you! Please complete this short form by November 30, 2019! Upworthy saw awesome, meaningful, and visual content as their sweet spot Upworthy‚Äôs traffic peaked in November 2013 when the company reached more people than the New York Times. In response, Facebook created one of its first widely-publicized algorithmic policies in 2014. Facebook‚Äôs algorithm attempts to re-balance the NewsFeed significantly affected Upworthy and set the stage for the company‚Äôs later algorithmic policies. Ever since, the quest for virality has been an adversarial competition between publishers and platforms. In 2017, Upworthy merged with Good Worldwide. Upworthy conducted its A/B tests on its own website, randomly varying different ‚Äúpackages‚Äù for a single story‚Äì a headline, subhead, social media summary, and thumbnail. While we‚Äôre still verifying the data, we can confirm that each A/B test in the archive will include: The whole dataset includes 32,487 valid deployed tests, including 150,817 total tested packages. We also have access to Upworthy‚Äôs Google Analytics data for this time period, allowing us to record average estimated demographic information about website viewers over time. We‚Äôre still investigating the best way to do this. We live in a society where companies and political campaigns test and influence the behavior of millions of people every day. Used wisely, these capabilities could advance human understanding and guide decisions for flourishing democracies. We also need to better understand this power to protect society from its misuses. Upworthy‚Äôs A/B tests can help us advance knowledge in many fields, including: This dataset will also support classes like Nathan‚Äôs class on The Design and Governance of Field Experiments, where students learn how to do experiments and think about ways to govern this kind of behavioral power. The Upworthy Research Archive will also help level the playing field for research and teaching about online behavior. Right now, only a few academic researchers can negotiate access to data from the thousands of A/B tests that companies conduct every year. Students never have a chance to get hands-on experience with this kind of knowledge. Our dataset will change that. Through an agreement been Good and Cornell University, we have been granted complete permission to publish the dataset openly. We‚Äôre still reviewing and cleaning the dataset, which will only include aggregate results and will not include any identifiable information about individuals. We also expect to have general demographic information about the kind of people who were viewing Upworthy during a given study. We plan to release the data in stages to increase the credibility of the initial scientific discoveries. Given a large enough dataset, it‚Äôs easy to fish for answers, even with good intentions. Inspired by lessons from the Fragile Families Challenge and the Psychological Science Accelerator, we are planning a multi-stage process for: To set up that process we need academics and educators to tell us what you would do with this data. Once we know what people from different fields want to do with the dataset, we will be able to design a process to ensure the broadest high quality contribution to knowledge from the Upworthy Archive. For more details, you can see our announcement slides and the short paper we shared at the MIT Conference on Digital Experimentation in November 2019.

Because by implementing the principle consistently, this will indirectly bring more value in the eyes of the community. There are various kinds of platform principles that exist in this world. Did you know there is a platform that anonymizes all user accounts to process transactions. Where in general the current use of anonymous accounts to conduct financial activities is highly anticipated and avoided by other platforms, of course this is done to prevent undesirable things. However, with a strong determination and principles that the platform can carry out transaction activities safely and smoothly. This is because the platform always maintains its credibility and integrity for its loyal users. Did you know that currently Soraix is ‚Äã‚Äãalso doing the same thing but with a different principle. Currently Soraix is ‚Äã‚Äãpromoting the principle of equality in carrying out a number of buying and selling processes or exchanges. We can analogize this principle with a ratio of 1: 1, where 1 SRX can buy 1 equity token, even though the equity token has a much higher price than the SRX token price. For example SRX tokens have a value of $ 40, but can buy equity tokens that have a value of $ 100. This will certainly apply consistently because Soraix does have upheld the principle of equality. Nowadays technology can influence a person‚Äôs lifestyle from various sides, for example in fashion or investment. In terms of profitable investments, currently a number of companies are planning to adopt Blockchain technology. One way is to issue a number of equity tokens with a stable market value. This is done because over the years, the team of experts is increasingly convinced that Blockchain technology can answer various economic challenges going forward. It is the same as Soraix which receives a company‚Äôs equity token and trades it with its SRX token. It is not a taboo anymore if the Blockchain technology activists have now looked at Switzerland as a very potential and safe market. Of all the developed countries in the world, Switzerland was chosen as the country with the safest banking operating system in the world, which is very protective of the privacy data of its customers. Therefore, even though some Blockchain platforms are indeed vulnerable to various types of attacks. But the security system designed by the financial authorities in this country proved effective in destroying an attack mission. Therefore the authorities of this country do not think twice about allowing the Blockchain technology platform to play an active role in providing new colors for a number of countries in Europe. Therefore this also greatly benefits Soraix which has its head office in the City of Zug, Switzerland. In fact, did you know that currently the developed countries serve the use of certain cryptocurrency to pay for a number of public services, such as taxes and transportation. Indirectly this can accelerate the process of adopting the Blockchain technology system. Did you know that the City of Zug in Switzerland is now a cryto valley region. This will surely make this country one of the leading investment centers in Blockchain technology in the world. A developed country, of course, is a country that has succeeded in developing and improving important sectors such as the economy, politics and security. This of course also must be combined with sophisticated technological systems, such as Soraix which at this time has integrated Blockchain technology for its operating system. This integration also allows Soraix to conduct stock trading in the form of equity tokens. This is done not only because Soraix integrates the Blockchain technology system or for profit. But this is because the usual stock trading system or what we are more familiar with as the IPO (Initial Public Offering) requires more costs. Therefore Soraix comes as a cost-effective investment platform. The traditional stock exchange system and the stock exchange system with an equity token model, certainly have a number of very basic differences. But now all consumers are given the freedom to choose between the two stock exchange systems. Therefore to run an investment, users must have enough knowledge and look for references related to the digitization system in investment activities.

Or do you visit religious temples on important days of your life? Have you ever been curious as to why you have been asked to do this? Yes? Hang tight with me then. Growing up in a moderately religious Sikh family, I was constantly asked to visit Sikh temples or perform some religious rituals for some reason that I could never understand. Have you ever questioned the idea of God or the practices that have been put upon by moderately or extremely religious families? (Okay, I am not an atheist and won‚Äôt be asking you to become one by end of this article.) If you have questioned the presence of God or have found him or her somewhere other than where I found, please let me know in the comments section. Yes, my questions about the presence of God got affirmed as I was blessed to witness the divine presence, but not in the places where I was conditioned to look at(temples, churches, etc.) and I didn‚Äôt even ask any religious leader or saint to make me witness the divine through some rituals or mantras. I found the divine and its potential in the unlikeliest of place, where I probably never looked or maybe didn‚Äôt even think that it existed. My search for the divine was very similar to the drunken man in the below story: A police officer sees a drunken man intently searching the ground near a lamppost and asks him the goal of his quest. The inebriate replies that he is looking for his car keys, and the officer helps for a few minutes without success then he asks whether the man is certain that he dropped the keys near the lamppost. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù is the reply, ‚ÄúI lost the keys somewhere across the street.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy look here?‚Äù asks the surprised and irritated officer. ‚ÄúThe light is much better here,‚Äù the intoxicated man responds with aplomb. Growing up in our culturescape we are sold the idea to look for the keys in the area with most light ‚Äî we spend years asking other people our doubts, reading books, visiting temples, etc. to find answers or the divinity, and then get upset when we don‚Äôt find it in the area which had the most light. While the keys to everything were always WITHIN. The divine that I was looking for in books, temples, oceans, etc. is always within me and in everyone. It is not an esoteric quality that only a few chosen ones will get to experience. If you want to experience it within yourself, observe within to the small hunches that ask you to alleviate the pain of some other being or animal. Observe the strong desire that you experience when you see some cruelty happening to any animal or a person, and you want to help or get those beings out of that pain. Or it can be a cause like ensuring people have safe data or electricity at home. These small hunches are where I found the divinity, the more I feed these hunches, the more the divine presence expand in my life. However, our culturescape gives a totally different view of reality. In our childhood, we are programmed with a kind of a self-image that propels us to always look outside or in other so-called by culture successful people for everything. This poor self-image unconsciously always makes us believe less in ourselves and more in others because when we see someone with social proof or with authority our mind unconsciously accepts them as the one with answers and we never search for the divine and answers within us. And from the kind of culture, I come from, God is the ultimate authority figure with an unbelievable amount of social proof. -- -- Founder @ Acify Technologies.

In fact, some would argue that these effects are already appearing. That being said, people often fail to take into consideration how the world got to where it is. You guessed it, we as humans have not only allowed it to happen, but we have driven digitalization to where we see and feel the effects of it today. Sure, there are certain things to be wary of. But, it is also important to acknowledge all that technology can do for us. In terms of workplace efficiency, publicity, and communicative strategy, there is much to be gained from it. The use of technology has drastically altered how we go about our daily routines: our educations, professions, and even our personal lives now revolve around online networking, social media addictions, Netflix binges, and our heightened reliance on digital connection for human interaction. There is a way to balance our wariness with technology with its significant benefits, especially for marketers. Here are some of the top ways to use technology to attract consumers to your business: Linkedin Business Strategy Linkedin is one of the best ways for working professionals to connect with friends, coworkers, potential employers, and employees, and share their takes on trending news stories. What is highly undermined is its ability to help businesses gain traction and reach new audiences. You can track business analytics, including page visitors, update highlights, and followership growth. Use Linkedin to more frequently engage your audiences and to reach new potential customers. Content Marketing Content marketing refers to the creation and distribution of content through online platforms. This may include but is not limited to news, articles, videos, and photos to be shared on social networks including Linkedin, YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram. Developing and maintaining a consistent but updated content marketing strategy is crucial in improving the online presence of your business. It is more necessary than ever to be active on various social media platforms, showing consumers why your product will make their life better. Although it is often time-consuming and difficult to manage frequent posting on various platforms, it increases engagement and expands the potential consumer base drastically. Sure, people occasionally find ads to be irritating or distracting. But, ads are inevitable and consumers expect to see them online. Plus, in a world where people are now often able to get past a paywall for free by agreeing to see ads, having your product presented to people is a solid way to gain traction and new clicks to your website. Despite the occasional feelings of annoyance amongst people online, the successful results of advertisements for different companies and products are undeniable. After all, 93% of marketers use Facebook advertising regularly , and Instagram is said to be rapidly catching up; so it is safe to say that their ads are producing some sort of success. Web Design It is imperative that you make your website stand out. In this day and age, consumers are visiting countless websites on a daily basis. In order to truly grasp the attention of new viewers and make your site stand out, your web design should be attention-grabbing. Not only should it attract new visitors, but it should also make people want to stay and click around, exploring the intricacies of your product. Its design should be simple and easy to navigate while having enough layers to show potential consumers all that your product can do for them. Pragmatics are important, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But, remember that technology can easily strip a business of its personality and character. The person who is typing a company update to the blog might be full of excitement and joy, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that this is relayed into the post without a conscious effort. Authenticity and ethics are becoming very important in consumer choices; for example, if a company has a reputation for using product creation methods that harm animals in the process, many consumers will be turned away prior to even viewing the product. Of course, it is important to be ethical. Currently, however, it is even more important to elaborate on and advertise your ethical practices in order to increase consumer confidence and brand likability. Developing and maintaining a digital personality is extremely important when technology can often feel robotic and cold. Undoubtedly, there are many benefits to be had from living with and around technology. In many ways, it makes running a business much easier and more efficient. That being said, it is only beneficial if you are able to remain competitive with other companies in your industry. In this day and age, that is done by being technologically sound and innovative. If you use the 5 tips above while running your business, you will be right on your way to rapidly drawing new consumers and clients to your product.

Sometimes the only person you can talk to about it is a few hundred strangers who may never know what you‚Äôre going through in real life.‚Äù ‚Äúthank you! It can be so isolating for sure. It helps to hear words of support‚Ä¶even from a random bathroom stranger! I hope everyone has a great weekend. I‚Äôll be boxing his stuff up and taking it to storage!‚Äù I followed the daily updates of these women‚Äôs lives with curiosity and amazement. ‚ÄúMarried women ‚Äî is marriage what you thought it would be?‚Äù ‚ÄúLived with ex fianc√© for a year before my now husband and realized I couldn‚Äôt live with him. He just had the worst home habits that got worse the more I saw. FF to my husband and we were together for five years and lived together. We knew it would work then so we had a kid. That worked out so we then got married. Not saying people shouldnt work to make it what they want, but growing together and seeing you‚Äôre on the same path before committing to marriage can save the divorce issue. Marriage def doesn‚Äôt fix things that were wrong before.‚Äù ‚ÄúMarriage is awesome and fun for a few minutes. Making a commitment that the world can see is exciting but I think that if you two are actually in it for the right reasons then it should be more exciting for the two of you to be together as a team in your own way than to need to prove it to others. Divorce is as traumatizing as they say and 10x worse than getting married is fun. Commit but just keep the government out of it! It takes 6 months to get divorced in California!‚Äù More women responded with their thoughts on marriage and divorce. Someone asked if a wedding is necessary, to which other women also wrote lengthy paragraphs in response. This bathroom stall iPad has become a hidden treasure that never fails to bring me a warm feeling when I stop by. I secretly rejoiced in participating in this exclusive bathroom stall community. Among the 200 or so people sitting on this floor, there is someone sharing her deepest secrets and someone that is listening. I couldn‚Äôt find a way to share this in front of all the male coworkers without seeming inappropriate. When I finally had a chance to bring it up at a women‚Äôs event, everyone was equally amazed. At the same time, a question emerged in my mind: What does it take to create a community? Back in 1986, psychologists McMillan and Chavis proposed a theory that outlines the four key components of a community: This theory explains the bathroom stall community phenomenon quite well. There are five attributes to membership: boundaries, emotional safety, a sense of belonging and identification, personal investment, and a common symbol system. The bathroom stalls satisfy three of the five: Boundaries: Only female employees on this floor could access this bathroom stall, providing an exclusive environment. Emotional safety: The bathroom stalls provide the privacy and iPads provide the anonymity necessary to make people feel safe to share their feelings and emotions. Sense of belonging and identification: As employees of the same company, people have similar backgrounds and experiences and as a result can expect to be accepted. 2. Influence Members of the bathroom stall community write words of encouragement and share their own life experiences with other women, and have influence over their thoughts and understandings of the events they are going through. The ability to help others motivates women to write these ‚Äúpersonal essays‚Äù on the iPads. 3. Integration and Fulfillment of Needs The bathroom stall fulfills the women‚Äôs emotional needs to express themselves and get advice on events that they are going through in life. When I spoke with a coworker that‚Äôs about to get married in a few months about the paragraphs someone had written on marriage, she became intrigued and wanted to check it out. On the other hand, women who provide advice are rewarded by the gratefulness of other women and the feeling of being valued. 4. Shared Emotional Connection Among the many elements that encourage shared emotional connection in McMillan & Chavis‚Äôs theory, the most relevant one is the contact hypothesis. A bathroom stall is a place that everyone has to visit on a daily basis, and therefore, the frequency of interactions allow the women to develop a sense of emotional connection with each other. The sense of community is not a hard science, but as all of these conditions are met, a group of anonymous strangers comes together with a shared purpose, and a community is born. Historically, women have sought solidarity in each other in different environments. Women in feudal China who were restricted from outside activities, had bound feet and dedicated their lives to caring for their families had a strong supporting network among their siblings, mothers, daughters, and maids. That network is what provided them with support and strengths in a dark period of women‚Äôs history. The Seneca Falls Convention was only possible because a community of women (and men) came together and found their voice in speaking out about women‚Äôs rights. The power of communities could have an impact as small as a word of encouragement for a woman going through a breakup, or as big as starting a movement. In today‚Äôs world, online communities could have even wider influences for its ability to reach millions of people instantly. Humans of New York, Pantsuit Unions, and Subtle Asian Traits are some great examples. As we become more conscious of the power of communities, I hope to see more communities that empower us, more communities of women carrying each other, and more online communities using technology to connect instead of divide us, and sometimes, it‚Äôs really simple: Communities are born - one bathroom stall iPad at a time. -- -- Founder, startup operator Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*u5CMnNOCXNV_U_1-QR-guA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*u5CMnNOCXNV_U_1-QR-guA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*u5CMnNOCXNV_U_1-QR-guA.jpeg"

Buy Bitcoin This article last updated Nov 19 Jump to Page Contents Introduction Who created Bitcoin? Transactional properties Bitcoin Token Economics Proof-of-Work Consensus Development Lightning Network Atomic Swaps SegWit Why is Bitcoin important? Established success Path to the future Market Opportunities Threats to Bitcoin Critical threats Obstacles to Mass Adoption Conclusion Bitcoin, also known by the ticker BTC, was originally created in 2008 to act as an alternative, decentralized payment method that allows users to be in charge of their own money. It envisions a monetary system that eliminates intermediaries, interest fees and other banking fees, and allows for transparent, verifiable, and secure digital transactions. The Bitcoin open-source protocol utilizes blockchain distributed network technology that maintains a public ledger of balances with each user that records all transactions on the network. This system allows for funds to be created and held electronically and allows for these digital payments to be stored and sent securely between users without passing through an intermediary such as a bank or payment gateway. What is a blockchain? Find out more here Verification of these transactions is based on utilizing computational power to solve cryptographic problems, and provides the Bitcoin network with a decentralized method of ensuring security and verification of transactions, and also the immutability of its transactions. This process ensures the integrity of Bitcoin transactions and is known as ‚Äúmining‚Äù Bitcoin, providing the ‚Äúminer‚Äù with rewards in Bitcoin. This ‚Äúmining‚Äù process is how Bitcoins are created and released into the market in a transparent way, with the Bitcoin protocol being fixed with a 21 million lifetime total Bitcoin supply. It is also the method to solving the ‚Äúdouble-spending‚Äù problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network, as a particular token cannot be spent more than once since it has to be verified by miners. More information on this mining process and the Proof-of-Work consensus below. A user gains access to their Bitcoin funds by a private key that is mathematically related to the Bitcoin addresses generated for a wallet, and this allows Bitcoins to be spent and transacted. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets which secure your private keys, and these can come in the form of software mobile or desktop wallets, or hardware wallets. Anyone who has access to the private keys can control your funds so it is imperative that this is kept secret and secure. For more information on which wallet to use and why, please see our Cryptocurrency Wallet Guide Who created Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous software developer by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who proposed Bitcoin in a whitepaper on 31st Oct 2008. The code was released January 3, 2009 and the first Bitcoins appeared. To this day the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown, and may very well be a group of developers rather than an individual. Nakamoto was active in the development of Bitcoin up until December 2010. The characteristics below are the main proponents to why Bitcoin has seen success as a means of exchange. Decentralization The blockchain distributed ledger technology allows for Bitcion to be decentralized with no single point of failure, making it more democratic and resilient. No single individual or corporation controls the bitcoin network, but each individual has the opportunity to become a processor of the network, further contributing to its security and integrity of the network. The development of the Bitcoin Core code is also open-source and committed code is verified by experienced developers. Limited Supply Bitcoin has a fixed lifetime supply of 21 million Bitcoin, being mined at a diminishing rate (mining rate being halved approximately every 4 years) until the maximum of 21 million has been reached. As of Sep 2019 18 million Bitcoin have been mined into existence. This transparent system allows for a reliable and mathematical money supply, as well as preventing the money printing flaw of traditional fiat currencies which leads to consistent inflation and long term devaluation. Pseudonymity Neither transactions nor accounts on the Bitcoin blockchain are connected to real-world identities or any personal information, however in practice each wallet address and historical blockchain transaction can be used to identify and track users. This allows for digital accountability of transactions and a permanent paper trail for regulation, but the analysis of the transaction flow will still be disconnected from the real world identity of users. Immutability The Bitcoin protocol provides an immutable ledger, so all transactions and records of transactions cannot be tampered with or reversed. This property is essential for a digital currency as it provides validation for transactions and values. Divisibility The Bitcoin currency can be divided up or tokenized into one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC) ‚Äî this denomination is also called one ‚Äòsatoshi‚Äô. This divisibility allows easier long-term use of the cryptocurrency, and allows for micro-transactions and precise values. Fast Global Transactions The Bitcoin system spans a global network of users and devices and therefore ignores our inherent transaction limitations with government owned fiat currencies. Bitcoin transactions are propagated nearly instantly in the network and confirmed in a few minutes regardless of user locations. Permission-less No permission is required to become part of and contribute to the Bitcoin blockchain network, which is a core property contributing to the decentralized public characteristics of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin system also allows for users to be in charge of their own money, with no third party or intermediary required to send or receive Bitcoins. From a supply perspective Bitcoin has a lifetime limit of 21 million total Bitcoins, and as at Sep 2019 18 million Bitcoins have been mined and released into the network. Inflation rate is currently at ~3.9% (Oct 19). It is estimated that 30% of all mined Bitcoins have been lost forever, as people have lost access to the private keys to access their Bitcoin. In addition to this, Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to own roughly 600,000‚Äì1,000,000 BTC that have never been moved from their original wallet. Therefore Bitcoin is long-term inherently a deflationary currency. Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network average around $3.53 USD with an average confirmation time of 10.08 minutes (As Nov 19). There are several key technological breakthroughs that are in development at the moment (more information on SegWit, Lightning Network, or Atomic Swaps below) that will contribute to decreasing transaction confirmation times and fees. The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, the algorithm behind the Bitcoin ‚Äúmining‚Äù process, is the characteristic of the Bitcoin network that allows for secure, tamper-resistant consensus of transactions and blockchain ledgers. A pending transaction (or block) is chronologically added to the chain in a queue, and individual miners compete with each other using computational power to solve the cryptographic problems associated with the block and transaction. This problem is difficult to solve but easy to verify, and the answer is called a ‚Äúhash‚Äù. A finalized transaction has its block removed from this chain along with the exchange of funds and a reward for the miner ‚Äî providing a creative way to issue the currency and also an incentive for people to mine. For mining rewards a miner is issued a 12.5 BTC reward for each block mined, the rate of which halves every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). The next halving is expected during May 2020 and will cut the block mining reward to 6.25 BTC. The Bitcoin code is open-source and therefore any developer can contribute, although the commits are reviewed by experienced developers. There are currently over 100 volunteer contributors on Bitcoin GitHub with over 30 commits a week written in C++. Along with that, there is a vast ecosystem of solutions being developed that will add functionality and usability to Bitcoin, with the main blockchain improvements being: Lightning Network Lightning Network is a layer 2 protocol in development that will potentially vastly improve the blockchain payment process, aiming to increase transaction speeds to near-instant and decrease fees to almost non-existent, allowing Bitcoin to be exponentially more scalable and reducing the number of transactions that need to be stored on the blockchain. The Lightning Network will work by having funds held in smart contract ‚Äúpayment channels‚Äù between two users so transactions can be processed outside of the main blockchain. Only the final state of the transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. This will enable users to create payment channels between any two parties on the 2nd Lightning Network layer, and allow additional security and anonymity as transactions are done on the 2nd layer. This technology has only been launched in 2018 for Bitcoin and faces issues with mainstream adoption, but with it being developed for other cryptocurrencies like Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) it will be growing rapidly in usage. The implementation of Lightning Network is also essential to pave the way for cross-chain Atomic Swaps that may lead to truly decentralized exchanges and inter-operability between crypto assets. Atomic Swaps Atomic Swaps, also known as cross-chain trading, is an innovation in development that will allow users to trade directly with one another wallet-to-wallet, eliminating the need for a third party service like a cryptocurrency exchange. Parties will have full ownership and control of their private keys throughout this whole process, and as the name suggests, atomic swaps can be executed between separate blockchains and coins. They can also be executed in 2nd Layer off-chain channels connected to the main blockchain such as Lightning Network. This allows for inter-operability between crypto assets as users can swap easily between each other across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and also allows for the potential of fee-less decentralized exchanges that provides atomic swap services to users. This technology in late 2019 is still very early on, so functionality and execution still need to be worked on for mainstream adoption. Also there are currently a very low number of compatible wallets and exchanges as they need to have the correct hash algorithm to take part in atomic swaps. SegWit SegWit (short for segregated witness) is a protocol upgrade which aims to address Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability problem by changing the way data is stored. The maximum block size in the main Bitcoin protocol is 1MB which restricts the number of transactions to 7 transactions per second, which will severely limit the potential of Bitcoin for high volume mainstream adoption. The SegWit upgrade strips out the signature data from the transaction to allow a greater number of transactions in Bitcoin‚Äôs blocks from lighter transactions. Wallets still need to opt in for SegWit support and exchanges/wallet providers still need to roll out support for SegWit, so this upgrade still has a long way in terms of adoption. The SegWit protocol change also allowed for the development of 2nd layer protocols such as Lightning Network by fixing the transaction malleability flaw that allowed people to modify the transaction details but not the content. In this section i will try to explain the potential for Bitcoin and analyse the growth factors that will be the main reasons why Bitcoin will be successful moving forward. Established success Bitcoin has enjoyed consistent exponential long-term growth in trading price from its inception in late 2008 driven by fundamental strengths of the Bitcoin protocol as well as market and macro-economic trends. It is easy to purchase and to hold as an investment and provides the ability to transfer funds across borders cheaply and efficiently. Bitcoin has survived 10+ years without having any compromise in its core software lines, and has a long record of resilience against various obstacles. In spite of these obstacles Bitcoin has sustained consistent strength with an average of 235% annual return and the ecosystem has improved vastly on its weaknesses, remaining as the perennial number one cryptocurrency throughout its lifetime. It now maintains its position as the most decentralized and least volatile cryptocurrency, and has the clearest use case and path to success in the crypto ecosystem. Some major obstacles that Bitcoin has overcome or is currently enduring below: Bitcoin has consistently grown in network transaction volume regardless of market price, with transaction volume now surpassing PayPal and approaching MasterCard volume, which is a great indicator of its use and growing adoption. Bitcoin‚Äôs momentous growth has sparked disruption in strategic business and methodology for multiple industries: Its success so far can be attributed to a variety of factors, some of which are: Path to the future Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is poised to continue its unprecedented growth, as the factors that have led to its success are growing faster than ever before. Predicting the future is never clear, but there are a few clear variables and growth factors that should contribute to future success: Market Opportunities Whilst there are many factors that seem to show a very positive and inspiring future for Bitcoin, it is important to understand the risks and threats to create your own informed decision about Bitcoin‚Äôs future. We aim to cover as many threats as possible below and their what their potential is to impact Bitcoin‚Äôs success. Critical threats These are the major threats to the overall success and operation of Bitcoin, which have the potential to devastate to the long-term success of Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency industry. These threats are widely known and focused on by the developers and entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin community. 51% attack A 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, is a situation where a miner or group of miners controls more than 50% of the network‚Äôs mining hashrate and would therefore be able to gain control of the network. This would include monopolizing the generation and processing of new blocks to be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, and the ability to double-spend coins. However a 51% attack would still be limited in its exposure in the network, as it cannot reverse confirmed transactions, create new coins, or take funds from any addresses. A 51% attack would also require significant expenditure and little financial returns for the miners controlling the majority of mining power, There is a geographical concentration of mining farms in China due to their cheap labor costs and low electricity rates. There is also currently a centralization of mining power, as Bitcoin‚Äôs mining is centralized from its manufacturing and its consumers. Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of mining equipment, owns up to 75% of the market, and also controls a significant amount of network hashrate through several mining pools. However this would be a suicidal business move from Bitmain, as a 51% attack could compromise the Bitcoin network and lead to a sharp downturn in the whole Bitcoin ecosystem, from Bitcoin mining to the demand for Bitcoin mining equipment. Technical Vulnerability A possible critical flaw to Bitcoin would be the existence of a technical developer flaw in the coding, as a flaw could be taken advantage of to compromise the network by affecting the money supply, double-spending coins, or compromising past or pending transactions. For example, there was a threatening bug found Sep 2018 that could have been exploited to create new Bitcoins and inflate the total supply. This would have shaken the trust of the entire network, and was rapidly fixed. ‚ÄúIn order to encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious denial of service vulnerability, concurrently with reaching out to miners, businesses and other affected systems, while delaying publication of the full issue to give time for systems to upgrade.‚Äù Consensus Flaw Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol is critical to the verification and security of transactions on the blockchain, however it is relatively inefficient as all the nodes in the blockchain must carry the same records and agree. There is potential for an alternate system or cryptocurrency with a more efficient or superior consensus algorithm (like Proof-of-Stake). However the PoW process is essential towards Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and decentralized nature, as it is key to imposing limits on actions in the network to protect against DoS attacks, and doesn‚Äôt allow for users with money to be in charge of making decisions for the network Competing Technology It is very possible that a future competing technology overtakes Bitcoin, potentially due to easier use or stronger fundamental characteristics and functionality. It‚Äôs impossible to predict this scenario, but there is an opening for a competing cryptocurrency with future additional utility or a database technology to provide distributed database utility at a potentially lower price or easier adoption. However any additional features or utilities invented in the future can potentially be coded into Bitcoin or an additional layer protocol, with most of the ecosystem‚Äôs developer focus currently on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network. Obstacles to Mass Adoption Whilst the below variables are not critical to the overall operation of Bitcoin, they have the potential to greatly impact the market sentiment towards Bitcoin and its overall influence and adoption. Security & Scams Although there has been no compromise of the core software lines of Bitcoin, there have been multiple major security breaches in the wider ecosystem including hacks on exchanges, ponzi schemes, and proliferation of scams (specific major examples have been covered earlier in the article). With the complexity in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, this will be a major obstacle to mainstream adoption, but security and education is a focus of developers and entrepreneurs and this can only get better in the future. Users must ensure they are knowledgeable and employ the best security practices, including storing their cryptocurrencies in the most security wallets and using reputable exchanges.

Government regulation As Bitcoin draws monetary power and influence away from government regulated fiat currencies, there is major incentive for governments to take an opposing stance to Bitcoin to protect their own assets. It is likely that major governments imposing regulation and banning on-ramps or off-ramps for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would have a short-term negative impact on the market price. However Bitcoin is inherently built to be resilient to be resilient to government intervention so would grow a stronger more decentralized community around it. There have been multiple attempts at regulating and banning Bitcoin already, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan deeming digital asset transactions as illegal, as well as all Chinese trading platforms effectively banned from Sep 2017. Bitcoin has only felt short-term price implications from these regulations, and they have not affected the long-term outlook or growth trend. Illegal Activity For most of Bitcoin‚Äôs life, its use has been linked to fraudulent use and criminal activity by the media and mainstream public. It is thought that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had the anonymity and ability to circumvent governments and regulations to allow the empowerment of criminal activity. The most famous example of this was the creation of Silk Road in 2011, the first online drug marketplace which used Bitcoin as a primary payment method. However, the permanence of the Bitcoin blockchain actually allows for transactions to be clearly and transparently tracked between addresses, and with increasing regulation for the on-ramps for cryptocurrency (Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering identity verification regulations), it is easier than ever before to track criminal activity through the blockchain. Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain trail has recently been essential to track a child pornography server in the largest takedown of its kind. Also whilst it is true that Bitcoin is used for ~95% of cyber crime, the volume of this is small compared to the volume of illicit activity through traditional financial services and fiat currencies. The blockchain trail is actually much better for tracking and keeping individuals accountable for criminal activity, as traditional paper cash transactions can potentially be impossible to trace. High volatility Consistent high price volatility will be a major obstacle to mainstream adoption and to Bitcoin being a reliable store of value, as it will require a certain appetite for risk that many people will not want to be involved in. Volatility is currently at a 60 day estimate of 2.79%. We are still very early in the bitcoin journey and higher levels of adoption would lead to lower variance in market sentiment and lower volatility in price overall. Also there are mechanisms in the market to reduce volatility and difference in pricing between geographical markets, including Complexity The introduction of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem comes with a whole industry of new terminology and complicated systems and processes, and the complexity of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has been difficult for the mainstream public to understand and embrace. The key to solving this issue will be for developers to minimize the barriers of entry for new users, with minimal disruption to their transaction processes and minimal knowledge required to utilize the new technology. Optimally the blockchain technology will be on the back-end of development, with interfaces developed so that mainstream users do not even know that they are using cryptocurrency tokens for transactions. Hoarding Speculation on higher future prices does encourage the hoarding of Bitcoin rather than the spending, which limits Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to serve as a medium of exchange. Nevertheless this is an indirect downside of a highly appreciating asset which is preferable to fiat currencies or other stores of wealth which are consistently debased over time. Also Bitcoin has evolved to also act as a store of value due to its ease in storage, transaction, and speculation. High Transaction Fees Sustained high transaction fees for transactions on the Bitcoin network would allow the use-case for cheaper and more efficient transaction systems. Fees currently average $3.53 USD on the Bitcoin network and increase in times of high transaction volume, and there are already alternatives in the cryptocurrency ecosystem with fee-less or near-zero fee structures. Developers on Bitcoin Core and the wider Bitcoin network are focusing on efficiency improvements, with SegWit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Swaps some of the developments that promise to vastly improve transaction efficiency and therefore transaction fees. Privacy concerns The Bitcoin blockchain has permanent and immutable records of all historical addresses and transactions, and there are concerns over the link between these addresses to real world identities. It could be possible in the future to easily link real world identities to their transactions and addresses on the network, alongside the negative implications of your private data being public. Governments and corporations could also potentially have wide visibility over individual and global spending data, so it is imperative that Bitcoin remains at least pseudonymous to prevent the exploitation of network data. Bitcoin is currently pseudonymous and 2nd layer Lightning Network transactions are even further removed from real world identities. Power consumption concerns There are also widespread electricity use concerns of the Bitcoin network, since the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol requires computational power to process transactions. The Bitcoin network does consume a lot of power; with current estimates saying that Bitcoin is using around 7.8 gigawatts of electricity, equal to 0.23% of the world‚Äôs supply. However it is the carbon footprint that is important, and bitcoin mining is trending towards areas and methods of cheap renewable power, such as hydropower and geothermal energy, so it can be said that the Bitcoin network is a catalyst for a shift towards global renewable energies. A concern is that there is a geographical concentration of mining in China, where coal still supplies ~72% of the nation‚Äôs electricity. Bitcoin has seen a hugely successful 10+ year run since its inception in 2008, and has inspired and educated millions around the world to the importance of decentralization and blockchain technology. It is currently poised to continue its cryptocurrency market dominance and to spearhead the growth of the industry as a whole, especially coming up on the halving of its block reward rate in 2020. Bitcoin could potentially be the largest wealth transfer event in human history, as it looks to disrupt the global payments, cash holdings, and store of value industries. There are well known obstacles and threats to its use case and influence, however Bitcoin‚Äôs developer and user community are able to help it overcome these obstacles as they have done for its lifetime. Bitcoin has shown strong resilience to obstacles so far, and there are no indications that it will fail to do so in the future.

https://medium.com/@EYIF/is-the-digital-skill-transition-a-gender-transition-9bea88b3f17c?source=tag_archive---------54-----------------------,Is the digital skill transition a gender transition?,Written by European Young Innovators Forum (EYIF),European Young Innovators Forum (EYIF),No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in European Young Innovators Forum (EYIF) Follow -- Listen Share The spread of digital is now having a massive impact on the way work is organised and structured. Workers must acquire new skills to remain competitive in the labour market, while new jobs emerge. When it comes to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), women remain an important part of the workforce, representing 23,4% of the entrepreneurs in the sector. The number of women in this field shows that the digital transition has struck, even in a traditionally male sector. The digital sector has slowly appeared but is blowing up. Indeed, most innovation or noticeable breakthroughs are directly linked to technology. Technology has started being used in very precise areas but tends to be enlarged in all sectors. Missing the digital transition would end in missing various job opportunities. In fact, in 2015 about 5,8% of workers were employed in the digital sector but all working sectors are now using technology, therefore, dealing with technology is basically no longer an option. However, statistics show that 25% of European men and 27% of European women still have no or low digital skills. Furthermore, most people working in the ICT sector are men. Only 16,7% are female ICT specialists. This takes its origin from two factors. First, there are not as many women as men studying ICT related subjects (24 out of 1000) and out of these 24 only 6 will work in this field. Second, only 0,4% of girls expect to work in ICT. In fact, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) underlines that ‚Äúby age 15, girls and boys already have different levels of confidence and skills in the use of digital devices [‚Ä¶]. For example, most boys confronted with a problem with digital devices start solving it on their own or they feel more comfortable than girls in using digital devices they are less familiar with‚Äù. One question appears to be pressing: How can women be part of the digital transition? For many people, technology in its entirety is a masculine area. And in order to maximise chances for a woman to work in this sector, it is necessary to deconstruct all negative stereotypes. The main instrument to achieve this objective is education, which allows targeting multiple goals: it will help in deconstructing all preconceived ideas but also in democratising the access of the sector. With the aim of tackling the lack of women in the ICT sector and of giving better access to it, the EU has launched the Digital Opportunity traineeships scheme. This pilot project has emerged to give students and recent graduates the opportunity to strengthen skills in different ICT areas like AI, Cyber Security, Coding, etc. This initiative is implemented through universities and the Erasmus+ programme and will make students acquiring the maturity and the experience to be competitive. All students or graduates can apply in their home university and can have the access to all offers on the online platform or through the university career office. The EU has even launched the Digital Skill Award to promote the most innovative project that proves excellent digital skills. It is also a good way to reveal local initiatives that are not well promoted. Being nominated and awarded with the Digital Skill Award validates the quality of the project. For example, in the category Education, the ‚ÄúAdopt a School!‚Äù project aims to familiarise primary school students with technology by creating partnerships between schools and Romanian IT professionals. All activities are mentored by professional volunteers. This project helps to link entrepreneurs and the future workforce. Even if the pupils won‚Äôt be soon in the labour market, it gives them a brief overview of certain possibilities linked to the profession. Also, it provides them with some initial knowledge of technology. Having digital skills is not an asset anymore but an absolute necessity to access the labour market. Education is the main instrument policy makers want to promote in order to boost ICT sector skills and to enlarge its accessibility. This field should be considered by young people as a possible career option since it is estimated that 500 000 vacancies will be unfilled by 2020 in the ICT sector. The main aspects that would help to minimise the gender gap in the ICT sector is the sector itself. According to statistics, women are looking for flexibility in their work and this becomes the main reason why women start a career in entrepreneurship. The flexibility provided by the ICT sector is an asset to push better gender equality in the sector. Moreover, according to the EIGE, implementing more women in technological areas would generate an imrpovement in GDP of ‚Ç¨ 820 billion by 2050. The Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has announced that several programmes will be launched to work on expanding the presence of women in the ICT sector. From a policy level, Bulgaria is a very good example of successful combination between European, governmental and local initiatives since women represent about 35% of the ICT sector ‚Äî the highest rate across Europe. The workforce is facing new work structures and has to adapt to the new challenges introduced by the digital sphere. It must embrace the digital world to reinforce work capacity and competitiveness. Multidisciplinary skills are needed as far as digital skills are needed in all job sectors. The digital knowledge of workers must improve in parallel with the modernisation of the industry. The transition must act on both sides. It is a simultaneous improvement from both machines and the human capital. Either of them works without the other one. To this purpose, programmes are offered to workers to understand the skills required for new technologies. As briefly shown, Europe has launched many initiatives in order to solve problems related to the digital transition. By educating and giving people a chance to be familiar with the digital world, Europe can tackle the number of people without any technical skills and level up the number of women working in the ICT sector. -- -- EYIF is the leading foundation for youth innovation across Europe.

https://medium.com/igeneris/stadia-la-nueva-entrop%C3%ADa-de-google-9289a0981f91?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,Stadia: La nueva entrop√≠a de Google,"No nos perdamos, Google no es un ente altruista.",Daniel Garc√≠a Miranda,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Garc√≠a Miranda Follow Igeneris -- Share Otra vez Google ha puesto en pr√°ctica su dominio en esto de los ‚Äújuegos‚Äù digitales para hacer acto de presencia y acaparar toda la atenci√≥n del mundo, no sin fama, no sin motivos, sobre todo con motivos. Lo ha hecho con la misma marcialidad y pericia que aquel chulo de barrio, que nos destrozaba a todos al Street Fighter o Mortal Kombat en los recres. Sabiendo que lo tiene muy f√°cil para ganar. Esta vez en el mundo del gaming. Mientras que en el panorama actual dos de los tres grandes protagonistas, Sony y Microsoft, se dejan querer hablando de sus nuevas improntas para el a√±o que viene, PlayStation 5 y Xbox Scarlett, (el tercero es el PC üòé), Google ha presentado Stadia, su servicio de streaming de videojuegos abstra√≠do completamente de comodities como los Blu-Rays o dispositivos f√≠sicos inmuebles. Vaya locura, ¬øeh? Sin duda alguna este momento es el m√°s adecuado y se est√°n dando una serie de condiciones especificas: la vida de las √∫ltimas consolas de PlayStation y Xbox llegan a su final, su p√∫blico objetivo -cada vez m√°s amplio seg√∫n avanzan los a√±os- es conocedor y consumidor de servicios streaming, ademas de que est√° preparado para un cambio de plataforma de videojuegos. En resumidas cuentas, tiene al p√∫blico entrenado para consumir servicios de streaming y listo para cambiar. Adicionalmente a esto, tenemos entre manos un sector que lleva m√°s de treinta a√±os tremendamente sustentado en dogmas que demandan ser quebrados, dogmas que apuntalan una situaci√≥n de quietud y cautividad: hasta ahora escog√≠as una consola y te subordinabas al listado de t√≠tulos comunes a todas las principales consolas, as√≠ como a una suerte de t√≠tulos exclusivos de la consola electa -n√≥tese el concepto de suerte-. Con Stadia hablamos de desordenar un statu quo, hablamos de introducir un alto nivel de caos, hasta el punto de generar una crisis positiva en un negocio anquilosado, hablamos de cambiar un sector de productos por un sector de servicios‚Ä¶ y todos sabemos lo que pasa cuando enfrentamos a una empresa que promociona producto frente a otra que promociona servicios‚Ä¶ Solo miremos atr√°s y recordemos en el ‚Äúda√±o‚Äù que hizo Napster. Si adem√°s tenemos en cuenta que el mundo del gaming, por lo general, se rige casi-casi por un paradigma de ‚Äúsuma cero‚Äù, similar al del mundo de los hinchas del f√∫tbol, donde el que tiene la Plei defenestra a la Equisb√≥s y al Pec√©, la apuesta del gigante californiano viene a hablarnos de lo que nos gusta, ignorando ese dogma y yendo m√°s all√°: el jugador. ¬°Por fin! Quedan en la retina hechos que son objeto de atenci√≥n, seguramente de aprendizaje para Google, y que despuntan dentro de un modelo harto replicado: casos como Steam, con m√°s de 50 mill√≥nes de usuarios y con 1,6 millones de compras mensuales. O el primer MMORPG importante: World of Warcraft (WoW) que manejaba cifras medias 5 millones de usuarios al a√±o durante m√°s de 10 en un modelo de suscripci√≥n de cerca de 13 ‚Ç¨/mes. O sin ir m√°s lejos los efectos econ√≥micos de los battle royale abanderados por Fortnite, con unos ingresos mensuales de unos 300 millones de d√≥lares en compras. Tambi√©n es rese√±able el anunci√≥ que hizo Apple en su WWDC del 2017 en el que, junto con su flamante nuevo iOS11, hablaba de un redise√±ado AppStore con foco en el gaming. Esto es importante: solo en Espa√±a, en el a√±o 2017, se gener√≥ una facturaci√≥n de 1.359 millones de ‚Ç¨ seg√∫n el Anuario de la AEVI (Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola del Videojuego). Una aut√©ntica pasada para un sector con un segmento de edad que solo crece. Lo dec√≠a al principio de este art√≠culo y lo digo de nuevo: sobran los motivos para Google. Las cifras, o los motivos, son tan demoledoras que uno se pregunta por qu√© se ha tardado tanto en lanzar algo as√≠, por qu√© nadie ha decidido en invertir en grandes capacidades computacionales para destrozar un axioma: es necesario comprar un dispositivo -consola, ordenador, etc.- para jugar a los videojuegos. Al margen de los intentos previos de los otros players, la realidad es absolutamente compleja: es necesaria una inversi√≥n descomunal para abordar algo como Stadia, lo cual hace que solo unos pocos titanes empresariales y tecnol√≥gicos pudieran hacerlo. Y precisamente porque algunos de los titanes han posados sus ojos en el mundo del streaming -Amazon o Apple son claros ejemplos- las circunstancias para Google eran id√≥neas: ahora o nunca. Sus cifras, en el aspecto t√©cnico, son aplastantes: la capacidad de procesamiento de Stadia es superior a la suma de sus principales competidores en esto de los videojuegos, PlayStation y Xbox, juntas. Google nos dice que nos olvidemos de una vez por todas de comprar soportes f√≠sicos para disfrutar de un producto que va a acabar de convertir en servicio. Va a normalizar y convertir un ecosistema de producto en un universo de servicio. Pero no todo es tan bonito, me temo: uno de los requisitos t√©cnicos de Stadia es el ancho de banda que requiere, lo que hace que algunos pa√≠ses puedan verse penalizados. Hablamos de 30Mbps, es decir, unos 105Gb de tr√°fico a la hora. Son unas cifras muy elevadas, sobre todo si nos ponemos emp√°ticamente en el lugar de los proveedores de servicios de internet (ISP). Si nos ponemos a pensar en los costes extra de ancho de banda soportados por parte de Telef√≥nica o Vodafone una vez que Stadia rinda al 100%, podr√≠amos estar hablando de la criptonita de la neutralidad de red; sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la exposici√≥n que hizo Cesar Alierta ex-Presidente de Telef√≥nica, en el 2014 ¬°Esto es otro debate! La propuesta de valor de Google es l√≥gica y ambiciosa: Stadia empodera al jugador c√≥mo siempre se debi√≥ hacer, ofreci√©ndole jugar en streaming, donde √©l quiera: en un m√≥vil, en la tele, en un tablet, en un ordenador, independientemente de d√≥nde est√©, necesitando solo un mando que puede conectar v√≠a Wi-Fi. Se empodera porque el jugador ya no tiene que mirar de soslayo a la consola que no decidi√≥ comprarse y ver c√≥mo salen t√≠tulos exclusivos para ella, eso est√° abocado a desaparecer. ‚ÄòDamas y caballeros, ¬°las reglas del juego han cambiado!‚Äô Olv√≠dese el jugador de actualizar su consola o PC, de necesitar un desembolso de unos 400‚Ç¨ cada 4‚Äì5 a√±os en una nueva m√°quina, de gastarse 60 √≥ 70 euros cada vez que sale un videojuego, de pasar varias horas actualizando ese juego reci√©n comprado, olv√≠dese de eso: encienda su mando, elija el t√≠tulo y juegue al juego que quiera.‚Äô ‚ÄúStadia ser√° una nueva categor√≠a‚Äù, pensar√°n muchos. Yo no lo creo, la verdad, creo m√°s bien que asistimos a una nueva demostraci√≥n de la segunda ley de la termodin√°mica, en la que Google, una vez m√°s, es el catalizador de esa entrop√≠a.

During this time of unprecedented uncertainty and disruption, as a UK based company, it forces us to take a step back and take a hard look at what we do when the sands under our feet are shifting day to day. Datum has manufacturing sites in the UK and US, a new location in Poland, as well as an office in Singapore. Within our UK-based business, our exports to the EU are a large part of our operations. Naturally, like any good business, we have contingency plans to mitigate the complications of any border disruption caused by Brexit with our facility in Poland. But the larger question is the future lifetime of ongoing business and manufacturing within the UK. There are many different viewpoints espoused by the new candidates for prime minister that will have varying long-term effects for the UK‚Äôs position and ongoing trade relationships around the world. If we look at actions that the large manufacturers have taken, we see firms such as Ford warning that a no-deal Brexit would be ‚Äòcatastrophic,‚Äô and Honda announcing plans to close its manufacturing plant in Swindon, UK. Many of these press releases, along with others, have been flagged as propaganda but the signals have not been positive for the UK manufacturing outlook. You can stifle the conversation, but the effects do not go away. There are so many possible outcomes from this political situation, and our viewpoint has always been to influence and control what we can, instead of waste time and money on things we cannot influence. Rather than complain about what might happen, we will set ourselves up in a position that we can thrive in any situation. At Datum, we constantly concentrate on creating things that people need and doing it better than anyone else. Our main market, surface mount technology (SMT), is constantly driven by miniaturisation and designing printed circuit boards (PCB) that give freedom to developers to create the new fancy phone or smart watch and the technology of the future. With this in mind, we have developed processes that open up the possibilities from a design perspective by increasing the accuracy of the products we provide. In doing this we have reduced the risk to future business from political uncertainty by taking charge of our own success and doing things nobody else can do. This will mean that, in the future, the value that we provide will be something that the market cannot get from anybody else. Even with the best talent and technology, we can never control politics or politicians; they will always be unpredictable. But we can control and influence our own capabilities. For a business to succeed you need customers, and you will only have customers if you provide something that they need ‚Äî investing into our products, processes, and innovations that help our customers is where we choose to invest.

https://medium.com/hacksters-blog/this-drone-is-a-real-life-thors-hammer-671b2195432?source=tag_archive---------87-----------------------,This Drone Is a Real Life Thor‚Äôs Hammer,Written by Cameron Coward,Cameron Coward,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cameron Coward Follow -- Listen Share In Marvel‚Äôs Thor, the titular character is a powerful Norse god portrayed by the equally-powerful Chris Hemsworth. Thor has many magical, super-human abilities, but it‚Äôs his hammer Mj√∂lnir that is particularly iconic. In-universe, the hammer can only be lifted by Thor, returns to him when summoned, and can be used to conjure storms and lightning. In short, it‚Äôs a nerd fantasy weapon on par with a light saber, and on the FliteTest YouTube channel they‚Äôve turned it into a working drone. This project was broken down into two major steps: constructing a replica of Thor‚Äôs hammer, and making it fly. The body of the hammer is hollow, and was made mostly from foam board that was cut by hand and then hot-glued together. However, the initial version wasn‚Äôt optimal for flight, and had to be completely redesigned and rebuilt. A coat of paint really sells the appearance, and they even made some armor to look like Thor‚Äôs garb. It was then time to make the hammer fly. It has a fairly standard drone setup that was made with common off-the-shelf components. The main challenge was to get enough air moving through the props to provide the thrust to fly. To do that, they integrated air ducts to channel the air through the hammer. With that work done, the hammer flies remarkably well for something so big and bulky, and the FliteTest team can now role-play as Thor whenever they want. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

The ideas conveyed by this phrase can seem incompatible. Those tasked with a managerial role in a company where creativity is a central activity are likely to understand what I mean. Whether it is web design and digital content creation or more traditional specialisms like advertising or graphic design, the act of creativity can be difficult to summon on command. It‚Äôs not like accounting, where you have a set of numbers and you apply some rules to achieve a result. The talents of creative people can‚Äôt necessarily be turned on like a tap. It‚Äôs not like maths where you simply punch numbers into a calculator. You can set up some processes and put your creatives into an environment that might be helpful to stimulate creativity, but there‚Äôs no guarantee as to how long it might take and how good the result is likely to be. It is this unpredictable nature of the creative process and the quality of the result that does not marry up well with the need for businesses to get things done in set time frames and to a consistent and repeatable standard. This seeming incompatibility is also reflected in the attitudes of creative people to rules. Creatives tend to see fixed ways of doing things, such as the strict rules that define processes, as bureaucratic. In the view of many creatives, such an approach kills spontaneity and gets in the way of creativity. In short, it ties them up in red tape and cramps their creative style. Despite this, creative businesses flourish by setting creativity free within a commercial environment. At the heart of a creative workflow sits the process of iteration and review. Working to a creative brief, collaboration within the creative company is the mechanism by which work is produced and reviewed, with changes requested and made. Additional cycles of review and iteration may be made until the output is perfected. Internal review is often required with changes requested by senior creatives, Project Managers (PMs) and Account Directors (ADs). Frequently, PMs and ADs take ownership of client-side relationships and filter communication between creatives and the clients. However, as successful as this approach is, it is not without a downside. It is inefficient and labour intensive, soaking up time because it requires manual tasks to manage and steer the passage of work through the process flow. At scale, with dozens of live projects and hundreds of creative documents across design routes and versioning, the precise position of every piece of work in the process flow is difficult to track and monitor. File sharing for drafts or final signed-off artwork files is critical in creative business. Email is of course the tool of choice, but it is far from ideal. It becomes flooded with attachments and filing often creates two different filing systems ‚Äî one for the written email content and one for the creative documents. Creative files are often large, (hundreds of MB or several GB in the case of videos or high res images) and so rendering email useless. In these scenarios, creative teams might turn to free platforms for file sharing. Again, this is far from ideal. With considerations like confidentiality and GDPR, using public cloud services is not best practice and may actually send out the wrong message about your creative enterprise. Clients pay good money for creativity and for some, such practices undermine the perception of value and reflect poorly on your business. Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is a class of software that enables companies to take control of document and file management. There are a multitude of solutions out there designed to solve the problem. However, not all are suited to creative environments, due to being overly complex or too rigid and inflexible. The best approach helps you to look beyond managing creative documents to let you handle process workflows as well. A good way of modelling document and process flows uses a simple system of circles, which represent a document or a process stage; and arrows, which indicate the actions that transition documents or take process flows from stage to stage. This is the finite-state machine (FSM) technique. Take a look at the simple example of daily feeding. A circle represents a state which the machine can be in at a given moment. An arrow that goes from state A to state B represents an action that can change the machine to state B, providing its current state is A. States are usually named as status descriptors (‚Äòhungry‚Äô, ‚Äòsated‚Äô) and transitions are usually named as action descriptors (‚Äòeat‚Äô) or events (‚Äò5 hours passed‚Äô): Figure 1. Sample Finite State Machine Diagram: Daily feeding Say we use an FSM diagram to define the workflow of iteration and review in a creative environment. The design document can only be at one of a defined number of stages at a time. The stages could be ‚ÄòBeing designed, ‚ÄòCreative director reviewing‚Äô, ‚ÄòSent to client‚Äô and ‚ÄòClient accepted‚Äô. The actions which transition the design document between these stages would be, ‚ÄòSend to creative director, ‚ÄòChanges needed‚Äô, ‚ÄòSend to client‚Äô, ‚ÄòClient says OK‚Äô: Figure 2. Sales Creative Process workflow using FSM Diagram Drag and drop tools simplify the modelling and design of document management and process workflows. This allows each creative business to define and order stages and actions in a way that is best suited to the way it wants to work. Where it integrates office process automation technology, ECM really comes into its own, saving a great deal of time. A key feature is automatic actioning of any transition based on given conditions. For example, when a document has spent X days at a given stage, a reminder is sent to the person responsible for moving it to the next stage. Such automated actions can be applied whenever a given condition is met. This way, creatives, creative directors, PMs and ADs do not have to concern themselves with repetitive tasks and only need to interact with the software when human intervention is needed. Layering in additional tools such as a metadata search, a PDF engine, digital signing and automated email enhances the power of a system, helping prevent important steps in managing creative documents and process workflows falling through the cracks. Ideally, with the system in the cloud, it brings the potential for additional capabilities and benefits. Secure cloud storage helps to protect intellectual property. This is an enabler of file sharing with clients and third parties by using web portals and secure direct download links. Security features might include password protection, expiry date, https and complete activity log and tracking with alerts, (such as when a client downloads a file). The corporate identity can be shown at all stages improving your client experience and your brand image. With app or browser interfaces there is also the potential to perform creative document management tasks with a single click on mobile devices. Generally, this helps smaller and growing creative companies as well as long-established creative enterprises to achieve a more polished and professional approach to document management and workflow. An appropriate FSM-based application that has been well thought out provides greater efficiency and certainty for managing creative projects. It helps to eliminate uncomfortable questions such as, ‚ÄúWho has been sent what and when?!‚Äù and so much of the time-soak and delay that occurs during iteration and review cycles. With an appropriate cloud solution, managing creative documents through their entire lifecycle and defining process workflows in a way that meets the demands of today‚Äôs creative enterprises have never been easier.

The fleet management industry contributes to a large extent toward the global economy by offering job openings and furthermore through tax returns. With the advancement in technologies, fleet management is expected to make positive impacts from this time forth. However, it has some areas of improvement like mobility management, operational efficiency, safety, and accounting. See More: Transport with Fleet Management The fleet management system can be of great use when it comes to maintenance of the vehicle as it can enable a company to set up custom maintenance alerts for regular tire or engine checkups and low battery issues. The system is expected to adopt self-driving vehicle technology that in turn helps improve driver efficiency and safety, increased driver productivity, reduced cost, and minimize road accidents. As electric vehicles gain more popularity every day, the fleet management companies are looking to use electric vehicles, which are more sustainable and economical. The system also alerts companies about drivers loitering, who keep the engine on unnecessarily. Operational efficiency involves delivering the products or services as quickly as possible to customers. GPS vehicle tracking helps in full vehicle and asset utilization. For a company, it may mean knowing which vehicles are available at that time to serve customers. By rationalizing the routes, fuel can be saved which helps achieve cost reduction. The fleet management apps will keep track of operations on a daily basis and also help owners to improve their business operation procedures and service delivery.

https://medium.com/rockx/mining-and-staking-simply-explained-4fbaf75c5620?source=tag_archive---------116-----------------------,"Mining and Staking, Simply Explained","We try to demystify what mining and staking is, in simple words.",RockX,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in RockX Follow RockX -- Listen Share To many newcomers or regular people who are not technically-inclined, understanding how the technology works can be a daunting task. In this article, we will quickly cover what a blockchain is, what makes it tick, and what mining and staking is. A database, in the most general sense, is computer structure that organize the collection of data. Companies rely on databases to store, manage, and retrieve information in order to power their applications. In other words, when a user sets up an account on an application, interacts with it, and transacts on it, all that information is stored in the company‚Äôs databases. In this situation, the control of the database lies with the administrators, meaning all access and permission must be maintained by a central authority. The administrator owns the master copy of all information collected on the application. The blockchain, simply put, is a database. It allows for the storage and retrieval of information for every user and transaction on the network. However, unlike a traditional database, blockchains do not rely on a central authority or administrator to maintain the database or process transactions. Instead, information is processed and stored across a global network of numerous machines, also known as nodes, each maintaining its own version of the database. This structure allows different people across the network to share information without the need of a central administrator. Essentially, there is no central point of failure in a blockchain; even if any node goes down, the blockchain remains unaffected and transactions can continue to be processed. Since there are numerous nodes maintaining its own version of the database, the blockchain needs to have a method to ensure that all nodes are synced to reflect a single state of truth for new transactions and wallet balances. This method is called a consensus mechanism. Once all nodes on the network have reached consensus, transactions cannot be censored and altered. Proof of Work (PoW) is a popular consensus mechanism first adopted by Bitcoin in 2008. For PoW blockchains, the consensus process is known as mining and some nodes are known as miners. To create and add a new group of transactions in a ‚Äúblock‚Äù to the blockchain, miners would compete to complete transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles that is built into the algorithm. What miners are essentially doing is to guess a 64-digit hexadecimal number, called a hash, that is less than or equal to the target hash. Using sophisticated mining hardware, a miner spews out hashes at a tremendous rate until they come to a solution. The first miner to determine the solution gets to create that block and broadcast it to the rest of the network. In return, a block reward, in the form of newly created cryptocurrency, is released or ‚Äúmined‚Äù to that miner as a reward. All other miners will verify that the block is valid, then proceed to add that block to their version of the blockchain, and move on to compete for the next block of transactions. The probability of a miner solving the puzzle is equal to the miner‚Äôs computing power in proportion to the total hash rate of the blockchain network. The more computing power a miner possesses, the higher the chance of them mining the next block. The bitcoin blockchain, for example, currently has a difficulty of more than 12 trillion. That means the chance of a computer producing a hash below the target is 1 in 12 trillion. In order to be the victorious miner, hashes have to be spewed out at an incredibly fast rate. This is the main reason why bitcoin mining requires such an immense amount of energy and extremely efficient mining equipment. The difficulty of the bitcoin blockchain is adjusted every 2016 blocks, or roughly every 2 weeks, with the goal of keeping the rate of generating a new block at about roughly 10 minutes. The more miners there are competing for a solution, the more difficult the problem will become. Conversely, when computational power is taken off of the network, the difficulty adjusts downward to make mining easier. In simpler words, in a fiercely competitive open network, the miner who invests in more specialized mining hardware and has access to cheap power will likely derive more rewards from the network. Staking was first introduced in 2012 by Sunny King and Scott Nadal as a concept for the proof of stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in a cryptocurrency called Peercoin. There are variations in protocol design across different PoS blockchains but the general idea behind PoS consensus is that those who own the largest stakes in the network i.e. holding the most coins, are most likely to have vested interest to secure the network and deter fraudulent behaviour. Unlike a PoW system where users compete on computing power to mine new blocks, PoS blockchains use algorithms to randomly determine who gets to mine the next block. Typically, this assignment is based on the size of the stake committed by a user: The bigger the stake, the more likely a user will be selected to mine the next block. Instead of getting block rewards, users receive transaction fees as a reward for committing and locking up their coins. Compared to mining, staking requires much lesser energy and specialized hardware to participate. Because of this, staking is seen as a more environmentally-friendly consensus protocol. Also, because of the design of the consensus mechanism, PoS blockchains enjoy higher scalability and speed of consensus, meaning transactions on PoS blockchains can be processed faster and cheaper than PoW blockchains. There are many other consensus mechanisms being developed in other blockchain systems right now, such as Proof of Authority, delegated Proof of Stake, and Practical Byzantine fault-tolerant Mechanism. While they vary greatly in their approach, these consensus mechanisms have a common goal: To build an affordable, accessible, and open network where people can exchange value globally, free from censorship, oppression, and surveillance.

Follow What‚Äôs at Stake in a Fourth Industrial Revolution? -- Listen Share This post is by Sylvester A. Johnson, Professor and Director of the Center for Humanities at Virginia Tech. In July of 2016, the Dallas Police Department set a precedent when officers deployed a Remotec robot to detonate one pound of C4 explosive in order to kill an African American suspect, Micah Johnson, who was suspected in the shooting deaths of five police officers. When news first broke that a robot designed for warfare against military enemies abroad had been deployed to kill a civilian shooting suspect, chiefs of police throughout the country immediately affirmed the killing and noted they possessed similar robots and would have taken the same action. For decades, science fiction films and books have conjured futuristic scenarios of robots and other intelligent machines killing humans or running amok. So, this killing in 2016 came as a shock to many casual observers accustomed to associating intelligent machines with fiction. For those who have been following the dizzying pace of developing AI robots and machines‚Äô intelligence, however, things are less surprising. For everyone, the fact that intelligent machines have now begun to play a role in matters of life and death opens a new chapter in the history of relations between humans and technology. It exposes the fragility of common assumptions about technology, race, and agency. And it implies that the domain of technology and necropolitics ‚Äî administering death and brutality ‚Äî will have to be theorized anew in an age of intelligent machines.[1] We are indebted to Achille Mbembe for theorizing what he has named necropolitics, the vertical assemblages of power affecting the ‚Äúgeneralized instrumentalization of human existence and the material destruction of human bodies and populations.‚Äù Moving beyond Michel Foucault‚Äôs theorization of biopolitics ‚Äî along with Agamben‚Äôs analysis of bare life and Carl Schmitt‚Äôs theorization of the political ‚Äî Mbembe urges that we interpret sovereignty and the nomos (the basis for ‚Äúright‚Äù) of our contemporary world through the lens of social data concerning the technologies of death, and political will to destroy populations of highly vulnerable people.[2] The robotic killing of Micah Johnson echoes the historical and enduring pattern of racial disparity in policing. Experts have repeatedly demonstrated that this pattern is a continuing form of lethal violence that US police departments use to engage Black civilians. (Consider, by contrast, that municipal police pursuing the White shooting suspect Dylan Roof swaddled him in a bullet-proof vest for protection after Roof murdered en masse a group of Black parishioners in South Carolina.)[3] Johnson, furthermore, was by no means the first suspect to create a violent stand-off with municipal police, but he will now stand in memory as the first US citizen on domestic soil to be targeted and killed by means of a state-deployed robot.[4] Why should we query the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and necropolitics? Succinctly, we live at a time when the furthest aspirations of military research in AI and human enhancement (synthetic biology and human-machine hybrids) are transforming the ability to alter our humanity and surveil target populations. What once seemed an unlikely convergence between questions of human identity and national security has now become imminent. In this context, the so-called new materiality ‚Äî to which scholars of religion have become attuned ‚Äî gains new urgency and prompts important rejoinders. The provenance of the most far-reaching and impactful AI machines and human enhancement technology is militarism, particularly understood as that greater complex of military-industrialism that links up elite levels of military executives, defense contractors, research universities, global commercialism (particularly weapons sales), technological corporations, and private banks. The race to achieve human-level intelligence in weaponized AI has emerged as a global pursuit, in tandem with plans for highly engineered biological human soldiers who might be combined with machines using implants, exoskeletons, and even methods of synthetic biology. Early results of these ambitions include brain-computer-interface (BCI) architectures. One application joins a human to a machine-learning system. This system then monitors a soldier‚Äôs brain, signaling to accelerate human analysis of surveillance video feeds. Other BCI applications restore motor and cognitive capacity to injured soldiers using brain chip implants. Autonomous weapons systems already exhibit capacities far greater than that of the Remotec used to kill Micah Johnson. Lockheed Martin‚Äôs AI-enabled joint air-to-ground missile (JAG-M) features ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù technology. Once a fighter pilot launches the missile, the JAG-M missile does the rest, allowing the pilot to ‚Äòforget about it‚Äô and move on to another task while the missile interprets its video feed, distinguishes its target from the larger environment, plans its own course and angle of attack, and changes its navigation course on the fly to neutralize the target‚Äôs evasion tactics. It is currently considered unconstitutional in the United States for weaponized AI to kill human targets without a human participating in making the decision to kill (a human ‚Äúin the loop‚Äù). This should not elide the fact, however, that multiple autonomous weapons systems already exist with this capability. So, the technology is ahead of the policy. And it would be irresponsible to assume that the continuing development of autonomous weapons will be tamed by the current version of our legal theory. This is complicated by the fact that national security paradigms have thrived on the perception of racial threat to reinscribe militarism as an expansive canopy traversing both domestic and foreign domains. The internment of Japanese Americans; the deployment of the FBI‚Äôs COINTELPRO against Black liberation activists, the Chicano movement, and the American Indian movement; and the counter-terrorism measures that target Muslims as an inherent threat to the nation and the racial civilization of the West ‚Äî all evidence that state enemies are perceived beyond and within national borders.[5] This is why civilian policing has become increasingly integral to counter-terrorism operations. As military research yields more advanced forms of weaponized AI and human enhancement, the repercussions for racially targeted domestic subjects appear ominous. This is true especially in light of the militarized policing that national security practices have normalized since the 1960s. Such was, after all, the point behind the Dallas Police Department‚Äôs decision ‚Äî along with that of other police departments throughout the nation ‚Äî to acquire military robots for civilian policing. The increasing stockpile of weaponized AI by police departments is not for foreign enemies but for domestic targets. There is yet another dimension to this subject that will demand critical attention as well: the humanization of machines. Humans are rapidly accelerating the pace at which intelligent machines become more capable of performing cognitive functions ‚Äî thinking and reasoning. Deep Mind‚Äôs AlphaGo algorithm is a widely noted example, producing unprecedented insights into what is perhaps the world‚Äôs most complicated board game and easily surpassing the most skilled players. IBM‚Äôs Project Debater is another, able to listen and respond in real-time to humans debating a topic to provide a richly data driven and shrewdly formed counter-argument on a given topic. Given the influential philosophical tradition that asserts thinking and reasoning are central to human identity, the advance of intelligent machines is raising novel concerns about the relationship between people and intelligent machines. At the heart of these questions are the debates over what it means to be human, whether machines can become human, and to what extent this will intersect with established practices of racialization.[6] Various writers, from Sylvia Wynter to Ray Kurzweil, have examined the category of the human in ways that interface with the implications of AI. Wynter has critiqued the long history of Europeans developing a racial conception of the human being by defining White men as the ideal human type, and all others as less than the ideal ‚Äî i.e., less human or not human. She argues that the European tradition of interpreting biological science has been a preeminently racist enterprise, which promotes White supremacism by locating evidence for race in the body. Wynter has examined neuroscience in order to explain how sociogenic factors (social reality, intersubjectivity, etc.) can change the way bodies actually work. And she emphasizes that sociogenic (i.e., socially derived or constructed) and phylogenic (i.e., biological) factors are equally central to constituting humans.[7] Wynter‚Äôs intervention should lead us to develop a more critical approach to the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù in the ‚Äúhumanization‚Äù of machines. As the human category is burdened by racial and colonial freight (the category has frequently functioned to distinguish among races, those fully human versus others), we could only naively regard the humanization of machines as a raceless enterprise. It is precisely on this score that Kurzweil‚Äôs assessment of human ontology becomes so useful. Kurzweil is completely uncritical of the racial architecture of science and politics. In fact, he has been rightly critiqued for his utopian view of technology: he assumes, for instance, that structurally-engineered racial disparity and necropolitics will play no role in the future of technology. His robust engagement with an informational paradigm for interpreting human ontology, however, is productively wed to the critique of race that Wynter advances. That is, by emphasizing informational capacity as central to not only humans, but also machines ‚Äî and more expansively, the material entities of the universe ‚Äî the interventions of Kurzweil and Wynter together enable an approach to assessing the human-object binary that contravenes the Platonic inheritances of Western epistemology; material no longer seems so foreign to informational capacity. Rather, it emerges as the means of that capacity.[8] If informational capacity ‚Äî the ability to embody or contain, relay, and manipulate information to produce knowledge, thinking and reasoning‚Äìis foundational for what we have called human experience, then it becomes firmly debatable that informational machines are perhaps already becoming human. The rapid ascent of intelligent machine systems witnessed over the past decade is surely a harbinger of things to come. It is most likely that we will meet with a continuing wave of unprecedented advances in technology capacity. The military-industrialism that continues to spawn the most ambitious AI applications and human-machine hybridization will not only produce socially beneficial technologies, but will also deepen the necropolitics that has shaped race governance. This, in tandem with the racial politics guiding the imagination of the human template for humanizing machines, presents a daunting challenge to those who might wish to instantiate a different politics for our human future, one not rooted in instrumentalizing disparity, death, and destruction of vulnerable populations. This will be the grand challenge for the race-critical guidance of technology in the years to come. [1] Kevin Sullivan, Tom Jackman and Brian Fung, ‚ÄúDallas Police Used a Robot to Kill.

https://medium.com/@VRDEurope/the-future-of-storytelling-bf691e4c7997?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,The Future of Storytelling,Written by VRD Europe,VRD Europe,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in VRD Europe Follow -- Listen Share The immersive nature of XR is a challenge to those accustomed to creating narratives in traditional media. Films, theatrical productions and art works are written, directed and created as if the audience is looking through a window from one particular point of view. XR, on the other hand, is a completely 360 experience. Creators must become elaborate world builders, filling a larger space and considering an audience who could be looking anywhere at any given time. How can XR break away from these traditional writing perspectives and break the boundaries of 2D narrative? How are sensory and synesthetic tools used for storytelling with multi-sensory design? VR narrative goes beyond the hardware and software itself. It extends to the environment and atmosphere where the experience takes place in both the real and virtual world. Pulling from leading innovators in VR storytelling in 2019, we will explore a 360 experience, an interactive narrative and a live experience that demonstrate the future of storytelling in the immersive medium. 360 VR 360 VR has been critiqued as mimicking the 2D medium of film. What‚Äôs different? However, when 360 VR is used to grant perspective in stunning 360 visuals that accentuates presence in the narrative, it is highly effective. In Everest- The VR Film Experience, Sherpa Tenji attempts to climb Mt Everest without the use of bottled oxygen. His journey is captured by cameraman Jon Griffith with 8K 3D Ambisonic Audio Virtual Reality. It‚Äôs one of the few 360 experiences that truly tempts viewers to look up to wonder at the highest elevations on Earth, and down into the abyss of ice and snow and dangerous crags. By capturing the climbers and the greatness of the mountains in life size- viewers are invited to be a part of the ascent. Much of this effect would have been lost if not for the great attention to audio. Without life-like clear and spatial audio, 360 video can feel flat and distant. Howling winds, the steady crunch of snow under the climbers‚Äô shoes, strained breath and words of encouragement were so real and near that it was easy to cross arms across one‚Äôs body during this experience as if to protect from the frigid winds. Interactive and Non-linear Eleven Eleven, an original science fiction immersive narrative by SYFY and NBCUniversal International Networks, is an original multilinear narrative experience designed in every purpose for VR and AR storytelling. It‚Äôs a science-fiction narrative with multiple characters who are on a race against the clock as a planet ticks down to its final moments. Inspired by immersive theatre, the experience features multiple storylines running simultaneously on a common timeline- in real-time. Three distinct modes are available for the audience to have complete agency as an observer. Story Mode enables the viewer to attach to a main character and automatically follow them as a passive audience. Explore Mode is an active role where the audience can freely explore the world to follow secondary characters and search for clues to uncover the mystery of the world‚Äôs end. Finally, Goddess Mode empowers the audience to be omnipresent and view the world as a 3D board game of sorts where the entire narrative unfolds in a ‚Äòtable top‚Äô version of the story. With original music by Bleeding Fingers designed as a spatial score, a character‚Äôs individual soundtrack changes dynamically based on the users position- seamlessly mixing with an alternate character‚Äôs scores as a user navigates between stories. ‚ÄúIn a traditional TV show or film, every viewer sees the same frame, at the same time, every time and the composer creates a musical soundtrack to suit. With Eleven Eleven, since we have no idea where users will be looking at any given moment, it posed a unique challenge when composing the score. We decided to create a ‚ÄúSpatial Score‚Äù for each character that fluidly adjusts in volume based on a users‚Äô proximity to that character,‚Äù wrote Mehrad Noori, Director, Global Programming, NBCUniversal International Networks and Creator and Executive Producer of Eleven Eleven. Storytelling With Live VR The music and tech group Miro Shot is the first to tour a live VR concert, looking at the future of live entertainment with immersive tech. The story? Worldbuilding with future tech. What does VR mean in live performance? The group began staging DIY versions of their VR performances while based in an east London warehouse in 2017. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd fill the building with smoke and blend the atmosphere of a gig with the sense of being physically present in the non-physical world that VR gives you,‚Äù said Miro Shot‚Äôs lead creative Roman Rappak. In a typical Miro Shot show the audience enter a room filled with projection mapping, dry ice, and atmospheric lighting. Once seated in VR headsets, the audience experience an audiovisual journey of virtual landscapes, live feeds of the concert, wind-fans, haptic seats and custom scents, all soundtracked by the band. Miro Shot is looking at immersive experience beyond the VR headset. Theatrical elements such as smoke, wind, temperature, projection mapping and more are a part of developing a new world for the music to enhance the narrative, both live and virtual. VR in these shows goes beyond what is seen in the headset. The pass-through camera enables the audience to see each other at times, to be connected to the physical space, and then to experience the world of the music itself, transitioned to a new reality. Researchers are also paying close attention to VR and music in a live setting. In Kent Bye‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄúNeuroscience & VR: Music, Body Sway, & Synchrony at the Institute for Music and the Mind,‚Äù he speaks with Laurel Trainor, Director of McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind. Trainor reveals that when people experience a live music concert together, they are more connected to each other as their brains are doing the same thing at the same time. These social cues gives us a sense of belonging and demonstrate the importance of people being physically synchronized with one another for social group dynamics. Music accentuates this feeling as people move to music together. When people move in synchronization- they feel inherently feel more connected. FoST at VR Days Europe In the Future of Storytelling, attendees will learn from leading visual storytellers as they showcase their works and explain the processes behind their creation. This year at VR Days join: Joris Weijdom, lecturer at HKU University of the Arts Utrecht and researcher and designer of mixed-reality experiences focusing on interdisciplinary creative processes and performativity; independent interactive story architect Michel Reilhac; Satore Studio‚Äôs creative director Tupac Martir; Double Eye Studio‚Äôs Kiira Benzing and more. -- -- VR Days is Europe‚Äôs biggest Virtual Reality Festival in Amsterdam.

I3SIXTY digital flipchart product review.,Written by Anna Makovnikova,Anna Makovnikova,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Anna Makovnikova Follow -- Listen Share At the beginning of my blog, I have promised not only to discuss the nuances of remote working but also to review some specific examples of technologies that allow to perform it more efficiently. Disclaimer: the mention of specific companies and products by me is not sponsored and/or not paid for. I write about what seems relevant to me and worthy of attention. If one day ads appear in my blog, I will definitely inform about this in advance. Today I would like to tell you about the new product from i3-Technologies ‚Äî i3SIXTY, which has been recently announced during Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) exhibition in Amsterdam. Considering my unquenchable interest in all the developments that are related to group remote collaboration, I have been following i3-Technologies for a long time, whose team creates cool innovative solutions that are applicable both in any business and in education. They create products that are needed by the market, integrating the latest technological achievements of the industry and finding them an elegant application within the framework of the task. Sometimes the birth of such products lies on the surface, but it is i3-Technologies that manages to put them into practice and fill them with useful features. It seems to me that this is exactly what happened with i3SIXTY ‚Äî a mobile and interactive digital flipchart. When I got inspired by its video presentation and shared it with my husband, he slapped himself on the forehead and exclaimed: ‚ÄúThis is brilliant! And it‚Äôs so simple that I don‚Äôt understand why no one had thought of it before!‚Äù In fairness, it should be noted that among the advanced business solutions I have already met a digital flipchart, namely Samsung Flip, that the company presented at the Consumer Electronics Show last year. Using Flip, up to four different participants can introduce their content or annotate directly on the screen at the same time using either their fingers or a dual-sided pen. The device is compatible through both wireless connectivity and USB, PC and mobile ports. I particularly liked the feature of rolling stream providing 20 pages of writing space, with embedded search functionalities available to instantly direct participants to specific content. And of course, Flip display can configure to portrait or landscape orientations to suit any meeting needs. However, with i3SIXTY, the i3-Technologies team went an extra mile, turning the digital flipchart, offering a 90-degree rotation of the display, into a full-fledged collaboration tool not only within one meeting room but also to interact with a remote team. To do this, the device is equipped with an integrated camera and dual mic, and it comes with a pre-installed Zoom application (my favourite one!) for video-conferencing. In addition to the usual writing on the whiteboard, i3SIXTY allows you to open the Web browser, take notes over the image, make a screenshot and then open it next to the other flipchart pages! And when the meeting is over, the work can be not only sent by email or transferred to an external device but also saved as a QR code, having scanned which each participant receives his pdf version of the file. How cool is that?! I think it‚Äôs better to learn more about the functions of i3SIXTY first hand by looking at the presentation of the company‚Äôs product manager. At the same time, on this video you can clearly see how easy it is to use the device so that it will not take months of training :) Of course, i3SIXTY is intended primarily for working with groups on the spot, because for a full-fledged remote collaboration it lacks the functionality to directly interact with the content for those who watch the presentation on the screen through a conference connection. However, for such tasks, there are other technological solutions with specially installed software, both in i3-Technologies and in other companies, about which I will definitely tell you another time. But if we are talking about large companies, where employees are regularly trained, about coworking and coliving spaces, about training centers, and so on, the advantages of switching from paper flipcharts and whiteboards to their digital counterparts are obvious. Imagine a trainer who should conduct a leadership seminar for the employees of several companies. Having rented any room he likes and that can comfortably accommodate the planned number of participants, he, using i3SIXTY, would be able to conduct training for all participants in the room, and also connect through Zoom those who for some reason could not attend his training in person. At the same time, the recordings on his flipchart would be simultaneously broadcast on the screens of remote participants, and in the end, using a microphone, they would be able to participate in a general discussion of the topic. The application of this technological solution in schools and universities is also endless. After all, it is possible to connect to the learning process even those who for some reason temporarily or permanently have switched to homeschooling. Every day I encounter the preconceptions about the introduction of principles and practices of remote work in modern international companies. And no matter how long their journey to the opportunity to work with employees around the world would be, when this happens, the best technologies, including i3SIXTY or Zoom, will already be there. What other solutions for the efficient work and interaction of the distributed teams are in the current business arsenal, I will be happy to tell you in the following articles.

Virtual reality definition: ‚ÄúBeing something in effect, though not in actual or in fact‚Äù It allows the user to interact with a virtual world right from the comfort of your living rooms. Virtual reality benefits are widely appreciated and very often come in handy. It is a computer-generated simulation or placement of one‚Äôs environment. It is designed to fool your senses and the unconscious mind as it cannot tell the difference in what‚Äôs a reality and what‚Äôs imagination. Virtual Reality environments can feel like your own reality. Virtual reality labs also exist in universities for an understanding of the limits of our brain‚Äôs perception. This is how virtual reality for education is being used. Virtual reality in health care is also a thing. For example, it is helpful for patients in cognitive behavior therapy. Virtual reality therapy can be used to diagnose and treat psychological conditions. On the other hand, virtual games, it‚Äôs apps also have a great amount of population under its influence. It requires specific hardware which not everyone owns such as a virtual reality headset. However virtual reality‚Äôs future is very bright and this technology surely has a long way to go. Augmented reality definition: ‚ÄúTo increase or to add ‚Äú It allows people to add digital elements into their actual environment. It is an enhancement of your real world with a set of magical virtual objects. Virtual objects can appear on windows, information can appear on walls. Just as if you were giving an augmented reality presentation. Augmented reality technologies have upgraded within years and augmented reality devices are within our reach. You most probably have interacted with augmented reality without even realizing it. I‚Äôm referring to social apps such as Pok√©mon go, Snapchat and Instagram yeah, we all have been there. Augmented reality for education is also quite liked as it gives the students a greater perspective. Augmented reality in construction is also an important tool as it gives the constructers the exact area and preview of the object or building they wish to build. Just like this, it has helped businesses on a whole new level. It has created a platform for businesses to come in contact with their clients. For example, if you wish to buy something lets say some shoes or furniture. Augmented reality will help, you can view the couch in your living room and see how it looks before purchasing it. The same goes for the shoes you can see how it looks, what size you fit etc. All of this within your comfort zone. Google Maps helps you navigate; you can view the direction on your smartphone easily giving you a clear picture of where you are driving.

So, its no wonder most of the technological revolutions started their journey from being a program for the military. In this blog we will get to know 10 such technological achievements which had begun as a military prototype and is now a part of our daily life. THE INTERNET The Internet or the World Wide Web was not always what we see today. On the current day, what we see is a refined network which connects the entire world and is made consumer friendly. However, its origin is traced back to the World War II era. It was the Cold War that led to the need for ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ) formed by the U.S. Governments ARPA(Advanced Research Projects Agency), currently functioning as DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the beginning of the modern Internet. It was originally developed by the U.S. to make communication between universities, research labs, and defense department convenient and secure, especially during the event of a war, back in 1977. For years to come, it was only accessible to academic and military elites. Finally, in early 80s, ARPANET was split into civilian and military domains. In the next decade, the civilian network was open for commercial use, which lead to the rise of local ISPs (Internet Service Providers). In the same decade, rudimentary browsers were developed, which made things more accessible to the general public. The rest is history, as the power of Internet disrupted traditional communications systems, mainstream media, and businesses. GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) GPS is so common that every smartphone uses it to find its location. However, it was in the 1960s, that the DoD (Department of Defense) developed the original Global Positioning System, as a successor to radio-based navigation systems. The idea was to use satellites to determine a user‚Äôs position on Earth by measuring his or her distance from three peripheral satellites in a process known as Trilateration. The system would require 24 satellites. While the system became fully operational in March 1994, it captured the public‚Äôs interest long before then. It was originally used for military purposes, such as giving submarines accurate positions for missiles launched. This system was perfect for keeping soldiers safe on the battlefield but also for identifying targets, improving mapping, tracking plane trajectories and more. President Ronald Reagan ordered GPS to be made available to civilians once it was completed in 1983, while President Bill Clinton later declared that the highest quality GPS signal should be available as well. READ ALSO Technology is Transforming Travel and Tourism Industry GOOGLE STREET VIEW In 1978, DARPA‚Äôs Cybernetic Technology Office funded a project, called the Aspen Movie Map, where a group of MIT researchers mapped Aspen, Colorado with 16 mm stop-frame cameras, using cameras mounted on cars not unlike the vehicles Google uses to create Street View. The military took interest in the mapping to improve training simulations. Google asserts that Street View originated in a project at Stanford University. And by now, much of the planet has been photographed and mapped. Not only is Street View used by the military to simulate combat situations and for other applications, but the public as well. Today, people can experience the world without leaving their home. AUGMENTED REALITY During World War II, Royal Air Force (RAF) planes were equipped with gyro gunsights. This rudimentary AR sight helped the British pilots shoot the Nazi Luftwaffe aircraft‚Äôs with better accuracy. On the German side, similar technology was being developed by Zeiss, which now provides optics for Nokia phones. In coming years, RAF and its allies added radar information to the gunsight, which meant that the pilots no longer had to look down at the instrument panel for radar information and then scan the sky for enemies through the plane‚Äôs windscreen. In the 60s, Hughes Aircraft company introduced helmet mounted displays, first implemented by the South African Air Force. Recently, it captured the imagination of the masses after Microsoft introduced complex Augmented Reality headset, HoloLens. Game developers such as Niantic made the HUD tech mainstream by introducing it on smartphones. In short, the AR tech has come a long way from fighting Nazis to capturing imaginary creatures on a phone. JET ENGINE Air travel may seem to be much maligned these days, but it could have been worse if it wasn‚Äôt for the invention of the Jet Engine. The design was being worked on in the 1920s by an inventor, Frank Whittle. However, it didn‚Äôt get put into use until the Second World War by both the Allies and the Axis powers. In 1944 the world‚Äôs first jet-fighter aircraft took to the skies in the form of the Messerschmitt Me 262. READ ALSO Top Futuristic Technology will turn in to Realistic In the years that followed, jet engine technology continued to improve, with the development and advancement of things such as pressurized cabins (planes were beginning to fly higher) and air traffic control ‚Äî things that play a key role in modern-day air travel. DIGITAL CAMERA The Digital Camera technology was originally used in early spy satellites where they were used to capture high-resolution aerial images of enemy installations. The technology progressed in the military sphere, especially during the Cold War and in the 1970s the first self-contained Digital Camera was created. This early technology would take years to progress into the DSLRs we use today. Today, digital photography is everywhere, even in our pockets. DRONES Nowadays drones are such a common sight that regulating them has become a headache for governments and there are all sorts of consumer drones available, whether flying for fun or for professional photography and videography. Although, it was in 1863 that a New York City inventor Charles Perley patented a hot air balloon that functioned as an Unmanned Aerial Bomber, during the U.S. Civil War. UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) would not be used again by the military until the development of radio control at the turn of the 20th century. Along with increased number of military operations, drones are also used in a wide range of commercial applications, including crop growth monitoring and watering, surveying, film-making, law enforcement, and personal enjoyment by hobbyists. RADAR An acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging, this system uses radio waves to find speed, altitude, range, and direction of moving objects like planes, ground vehicles, missiles, etc. developed before World War II for military research and development. Today, it‚Äôs used for a variety of purposes, both military and civilian, including air traffic control, weather forecasting, and in auto-car technology. Inadvertently, it was discovered that microwaves transmitted from radar equipment during WWII could also cook food, which led to the post-war creation of the microwave oven. READ ALSO The Mobile App Revolution has just Begun in 2019 COMPUTERS The original technology for computers was a lot more archaic than it is today. The original computers used punch cards and mechanical looms to solve problems. The technology improved at greater speed during World War II though, when an Electronic Digital Programmable Computer named Colossus was invented by Alan Turing to help decipher Hitler‚Äôs infamous Enigma code. The technology decreased the estimated duration of the war, playing a small part of helping the Allies win the war and kick-started the age of the modern digital computer. In the following decade, technology improved vastly and shrunk greatly, with computers, now fitting even in our pockets. BOEING 747 Boeing is one of the world‚Äôs largest weapons manufacturers. The Boeing 747 commercial airliner is perhaps the company‚Äôs most iconic product. Like most commercial jets in use today, the 747‚Äôs design is based on the Boeing 707, which in turn, can be traced to the Boeing 367‚Äì80. This model, nicknamed the Dash 80, was developed in secrecy by Boeing and unveiled in 1954. The plane was originally meant to test the long-range jet engine technology and was intended to be sold as a military tanker transport. Today, versions of the 747 are used by most major commercial airliners as well as by the military, including a version used as Air Force One. IN RETROSPECTION So, it does not take a foreseer to know what the future developments in technology in the commercial market may be. All it does take is a bit of insight into the military based technology currently being developed and voila, the future lies before your eyes.

https://medium.com/@ben_schleef/technology-in-todays-hotel-room-9fac9af36c5a?source=tag_archive---------132-----------------------,Technology in today's hotel room,What do guests expect these days?,Ben Schleef,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ben Schleef Follow -- Listen Share Technology has moved at an incredible pace over the past decade. It touches so many aspects of our lives at work and also in private. Back in the days, when things were at a much slower pace, hotels were in a position to deliver technology to people which they could not have at home. Being it internet connections or solutions on TVs in hotel rooms like Pay-per-view. I remember the days when content providers were shipping hard-disks to hotels to update the content locally. The disks were highly encrypted to make sure no one can steal the latest movies and take them home. Times have changed. Technology at our homes or even in our pockets is far more advanced now. In most cases, hotels don‚Äôt offer any Pay-per-view content anymore. Everything is connected today. So it is only logical that guests first and foremost need a brilliant internet connection which works seamlessly and provides bandwidth to allow them to use any kind of services on the internet. But apart from an internet connection, what else do guests expect today in their hotel room in regards to technology? Lately, I heard many times, research is telling the hospitality industry that guests want the same technology they have at their homes. I doubt if that research is true or representative and if you really can or should trust that. If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. ‚Äî Henry Ford Even if true that doesn‚Äôt mean that it makes sense or is practical to have the same technology in the hotel room. I believe every home of guests is different. Let‚Äôs talk about TV. Does every guest at home has an LG or Samsung TV? Chances are not too bad that they don‚Äôt and in a hotel, you can implement all different kinds of TV models. Smart speaker? Alexa? Google Home? Siri? Which one would a guest prefer and which one would be rejected to be used? Furthermore, all technology at home is customized to work in a way you expect it. With your WiFi at home. With your credentials at home. I believe it is not only extremely hard to match the same setup in a hotel room but also to meet things like data protection and privacy. What choices do I have as a guest to opt-in or opt-out? Let‚Äôs take a step back from technology for a second and still assume the guest expects the same as they were at home. The same bed? The same shower? The same pillows. The list of non-technology items could go on and on. Funny that no one ever talks about them but very specifically about technology. I deeply believe that guests are very smart and they know and figure out that they can‚Äôt have the same stuff as they have at home because they only stay a couple of days. At least for me, the word GUEST already indicates that they are not permanently in the hotel as otherwise, we would maybe call them RESIDENTS. Does that mean hotels should not care about technology in hotel rooms? They should care about it but in a way that is smart and seamless to match the requirements of its environment. Mistakes I see a lot are that hotels are trying to take the products, which are for the consumer market, and somehow squeeze them into hotels. In almost all cases that don‚Äôt end up in a happy end. Do you know what kind of people work in a hotel? You guessed it‚Ä¶hoteliers! It would be not fair to compare hotels to technology companies but lately, I got the feeling that people do. How do hotels then bring smart and seamless technology solutions to their rooms? Just to make that clear‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt find the answer to that in this article but let me share my thoughts on this. I mentioned already that hotels are not technology companies. What does it mean? They are not in a position to develop technologies themselves as they don‚Äôt have all these kinds of almost unlimited resources like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc. Hotels need to carefully consider which technology overall to ride. They have to be smart about their decisions on that matter and can‚Äôt follow any trend. Whatever technology they choose in the end, it needs to allow them to be flexible. Let‚Äôs dive a little deeper and see how it potentially could look like. I believe instead of pumping the hotel rooms with technology turn it upside down. Almost all guests bring the technology with them in their pockets. And it is a fact that by each generation these devices get more and more powerful. Let‚Äôs start the journey with the first point of getting the devices connected. That should not be too hard as guests WANT to have an internet-connection. I think it is almost not worth to mention that the internet should be free of charge, high-speed-bandwidth and bundled with a super easy and stable way of getting online. During that process, you could potentially already wire-up the device to the TV in the room in case the guest wants to stream their content to the TV. For content streaming, I would always prefer a system that is platform-independent but based on apps as especially popular apps run on both major platforms, iOS and Android, and allow streaming. Sure some basics have to be in place like WiFi or a TV. Going further from here things get a bit more interesting. Talking for instance about ‚ÄúMobile Key‚Äù. Instead of getting a keycard for your room you get a digital ‚ÄúMobile Key‚Äù on your phone which allows you to open the door. The door look needs to support that feature overall in the first place and you would need to have a hotel app in which a guest would receive such key. Do you see the flexibility here? If guests don‚Äôt want a ‚ÄúMobile Key‚Äù you could still issue them a normal keycard. I believe a dedicated hotel app can drive the technology further but lets the guest decide. The hotel app, if used by a guest, could be used as a remote control for the TV but there is always the regular control in the room. You offer a choice here. Instead of Alexa, Google Home or other smart speakers, you could integrate that into your hotel app. The guest can decide to use that feature or disable it. Independent of what you would like to control in a hotel room with a smart speaker, you are independent of the speaker hardware, you give the guest a choice and can even customize the language of the virtual speaker or let the guest decide because the hotel app knows from the device the language of a guest. And always consider flexibility. If your virtual speaker in the app can control the lights, for instance, you have the alternative of the light switch to the guest. Another thing might be that you can order services like food or other things within the app. If guests don‚Äôt want to use it they can still pick up the phone or maybe you the same options on the TV to be selected. The point is to focus on solutions that ideally are very light, easy to use and hardware-independent but flexible through software. I have mentioned some examples and ideas in which direction people in hotels should think regarding technology and some of them are not easy to get them done. It boils down to the point of carefully decide about the technologies to ride as a hotel company. We admire those fantastic and easy solutions which are offered to customers by Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, etc. Although they are easy to use, people don‚Äôt know how much heavy lifting it takes in the background by those companies to make them look easy and user-friendly for the customer. That is the magic trick of those companies and the reason why they are at the top. Hotels will be never in a position to do such heavy lifting but they don‚Äôt have to. Their main purpose is a different one. Hotels need to be smart about technology and make their bet of the right ‚Äútechnology horses‚Äù to ride to meet demands from guests. Finally, I would also like to mention the hotels which are the smaller, the privately owned, the family ones. The ones which don‚Äôt belong to one of the global hotel chains of this world and can‚Äôt even afford to spend any resource in technology. I believe having the basics like internet-connection and a simple TV is possible for almost everyone. All other fancy kinds of things I mentioned like an app, virtual speaker, mobile keycard, etc. Does every hotel need to have them? For me, there are two other things which make hotels very much unique and decides if guests will book them. One is the location of the hotel. It is a very unique feature that only one hotel can have at a time. Even if you build another hotel next door it is a slightly different location. The other more important one is people. Some would wonder why all the other items you can think of are not unique to a hotel. It is more or less an open market for every hotel. Everyone can buy the same comfy beds, same nice wall paintings, the same shiny tiles in the bathroom or even the same TV model. So what makes a hotel unique is not the technology or interior of a hotel but the people working there. Some would argue that even this is an open market because every hotel has access to the same resources on the market. And I would agree to that 100%. The difference it makes is how you treat the people you hire, how you inspire them, how you give them a safe environment to come to work each and every day. That creates the hotel guests want to stay in because humans are also social animals and they can sense if during check-in the receptionist is only processing or really welcome them to their home. A guest can sense if the employees you meet on the floor say ‚ÄúHello‚Äù because they have been told so or they want to. That makes the difference and drives loyalty so guests stay with hotels again even if they don‚Äôt can afford the latest technology in the room. -- -- Just a guy like all others in this world Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*QE2Q4Q_GiI7JYjHeSnNxaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*QE2Q4Q_GiI7JYjHeSnNxaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*QE2Q4Q_GiI7JYjHeSnNxaA.jpeg"

The article opines that Financial experts, policy makers, and everyday citizens want to know: How will government policies impact our families and what can we do about it? It sites a recent book, ‚ÄúBroken Capitalism: This is How We Fix it,‚Äù by Ferris Eanfar and explains the state of the global economy and its key problems in a straightforward, accessible style. ‚ÄúWhen the 10 largest corporations on Earth have more combined economic power than 92 percent of all countries on Earth combined, the 50 largest financial corporations control wealth equal to 90 percent of Earth‚Äôs GDP [gross domestic product], the richest 1 percent of humans have more wealth than 99 percent of the world combined, and the eight richest humans have more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of Earth‚Äôs entire population combined . . . it‚Äôs safe to say humanity is in trouble,‚Äù Mr. Eanfar says. Mr. Eanfar‚Äôs work is based on over 20 years of unique experience in economics, financial technologies (‚ÄúFinTech‚Äù), blockchain/cryptocurrency development, artificial intelligence, and military and government affairs. Three key points in the book deal with issues of defining value, following a vision, and managing innovation. Value: The book notes that money is not value itself; it represents value. Rather than focusing on money alone, he advises organizations to focus on the way value flows through their stakeholder ecosystems, which benefits all parties in the long run. Blockchain and smart contracts are still in the early stages of a 20 if not 50-year adoption and maturation cycle. Some have compared it to 1994 and the web ‚Äî Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger Vision: ‚ÄúIn business and in life, having ‚Äòvision‚Äô is about accurately assessing current reality, defining steps to achieve specific goals, and building a bridge between vision and reality based on discipline and effective execution,‚Äù says Eanfar. Innovation: Artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and other technological innovations can be used for good or ill. A chapter of the book is dedicated to the impact of artificial intelligence [AI] on government and the economy. ‚ÄúWhen lightning-fast A.I. controls the political and economic apparatus of countries through their automated manipulation of social media and web-based information channels, humans won‚Äôt be able to easily differentiate between policy outcomes that serve their interests and policy outcomes that serve those who control the A.I. and their political patrons in the government,‚Äù he says.

A lot of you have asked questions about StarKST (StarCoin), so we thought we‚Äôd put up an FAQ to help out. We hope this list is useful and please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us. We are always here to help! 1.Is it a form to build buyingwall when it is interlocked? Is it market price purchase?In case of interlocking, it does not proceed in the form of building a buyingwall and it is bought as market price. 2. What are the advantages of interlocking? Regardless of the coin market and atmosphere, it will help increase the price due to the constant purchase. 3. How does concert tickets interconnection through other sites work?In case of agency sales through other ticketing sites, it will be reflected manually after the settlement amount is received. 4. If you buy concert tickets as market price and buy back, where the money that you pay for concerts from?The cost of the concert will be paid in advance and will be followed by the concert. The cost for the first performance was the budget that was earned through the initial coin sale. It is the way in which the performances are resumed with cash assets secured for the performances afterwards. 5. I think a system that a large sum is linked daily for KST upside should be settled properly.When daily interlocking is done, there will be various interlocking activities, including a large and small interlocking, short term, medium and long term.

Iniciativa foi pensada na Calif√≥rnia e desenvolvida nas favelas do Rio por estudantes do Vai na Web Essa semana, 22 de abril, o Vai na Web colocou no ar, com abrang√™ncia global, o aplicativo Match4Action, uma esp√©cie de ‚ÄúTinder do Voluntariado‚Äù. O sistema conecta volunt√°rios com iniciativas sociais ao redor do mundo. O app foi idealizado por alunos de forma√ß√£o executiva, da Universidade de Stanford, e foi desenvolvido no Brasil, pelos estudantes de programa√ß√£o do Vai na Web, moradores de duas favelas no Rio de Janeiro: Complexo do Alem√£o e Morro dos Prazeres. A hist√≥ria do Match4Action surgiu no final de 2017, quando um grupo de alunos de diferentes pa√≠ses, da Universidade de Stanford, se reuniram para discutir e trocar informa√ß√µes sobre voluntariado e iniciativas de impacto social. ‚ÄúPercebemos que por mais que cada um fizesse um trabalho volunt√°rio, a nossa contribui√ß√£o para o mundo seria uma gota d¬¥√°gua no oceano. T√≠nhamos que pensar em como impactar milh√µes de forma exponencial‚Äù, explica Helio Mosquim, cofundador da ONG Match4Action. ‚ÄúInicialmente, o Match4Action foi desenhado especialmente para pessoas da √°rea corporativa, que desejavam encontrar oportunidades de voluntariado s√©rias e confi√°veis para ajudar quem precisasse. Quando conhecemos o Vai na Web, enxergamos que pod√≠amos ir mais al√©m‚Äù, lembra a brasileira Claudia Akel, membro do Match4Action e idealizadora do Impact Social Movement, situado em Miami, nos Estados Unidos, onde mora atualmente. Com um trabalho de design thinking dentro de algumas empresas se constatou que o movimento unilateral de conectar volunt√°rios corporativos e associa√ß√µes n√£o era o suficiente. Era preciso ser mais flex√≠vel e acess√≠vel ‚ÄúUma intera√ß√£o mais eficiente e profunda poderia surgir se pessoas f√≠sicas, de um modo geral, tivessem autonomia para atuar na sociedade, criando iniciativas de impacto para o seu bairro, cidade e at√© mesmo estado‚Äù, explica Aline, cofundadora do Vai na Web e executiva da empresa de tecnologia 1STi. O Vai na Web foi ‚Äúmatch‚Äù perfeito e o grande passo para dar vida para essa ideia. Os estudantes programaram o aplicativo, que foi apresentado na Universidade Stanford, no m√™s de mar√ßo deste ano. A representante da equipe, a jovem Evelyn Mendes e Aline Fr√≥es foram at√© Palo Alto, na Calif√≥rnia, apresentar a primeira vers√£o do sistema para os membros do Match4Action. ‚ÄúO desenvolvimento desse app foi muito al√©m do c√≥digo. Os estudantes foram respons√°veis pela investiga√ß√£o do problema ‚Äî junto ao time do M4A -, cria√ß√£o do design, desenvolvimento do frontend, backend, gest√£o do time, desenvolvimento √°gil e lideran√ßa‚Äù, explica Aline Fr√≥es. ‚ÄúFoi um incr√≠vel trabalho em equipe, que nos trouxe muito desafios e, ao mesmo tempo, muita satisfa√ß√£o! O app mostra a capacidade t√©cnica do Vai na Web de desenvolver software de qualidade. Eu tenho muito orgulho em fazer parte dessa hist√≥ria, que s√≥ est√° come√ßando‚Äù, aponta Evelyn Mendes. Como funciona o Match4Action? O aplicativo, que tem uma design bastante intuitivo, √© inspirado no Tinder, app de relacionamento. Os usu√°rios podem se cadastrar como volunt√°rios ou organiza√ß√µes sociais. A partir da√≠, eles podem pesquisar uma iniciativa existente compat√≠vel ao seu interess ou criar a sua pr√≥pria iniciativa, reunindo pessoas para defender causas relevantes. Todas as iniciativas publicadas na plataforma est√£o alinhadas com algumas dos 17 Objetivos do Desenvolvimento Sustent√°vel (Global Goals 2030), atribu√≠das pela ONU. Tanto as institui√ß√µes, como as pessoas f√≠sicas podem construir um perfis alinhado com os objetivos: igualdade de g√™nero, educa√ß√£o de qualidade, fome zero, erradica√ß√£o da pobreza, entre outros. ‚ÄúO Macth4Action nos permite criar uma rede de pessoas em todo o mundo que deseja fazer o bem, onde quer que esteja e sempre que poss√≠vel. Assim aceleramos o impacto social de uma maneira que n√£o teria sido poss√≠vel sem a tecnologia‚Äù, explica um dos membros do Match4Action, Saskia Verraes, da Nova Zel√¢ndia. A primeira vers√£o do aplicativo vai atender as √°reas de atua√ß√£o dos membros fundadores: S√£o Paulo e Rio de Janeiro; regi√£o de S√£o Francisco e Miami (EUA), al√©m de algumas √°reas da Nova Zel√¢ndia. ‚ÄúEstamos nesse processo piloto para que possamos aprender com as demandas dos usu√°rios e evoluirmos por meio da facilita√ß√£o em larga escala, gerando grande impacto social‚Äù, explica Mosquim que ressalta a compet√™ncia do time do Vai na Web. ‚ÄúUma ideia s√≥ tem valor quando ganha forma e se torna realidade. O time do VNW tornou um sonho realidade e vem nos permitindo gerar resultados verdadeiramente profundos.‚Äù Por enquanto, o aplicativo Match4Action est√° dispon√≠vel apenas em ingl√™s. Mas j√° √© poss√≠vel baix√°-lo nas lojas para Android e iOS. Vai na Web Criado em 2017, o Vai na Web, oferece educa√ß√£o digital avan√ßada e valores humanos para jovens de 16 a 29 anos de duas favelas do Rio de Janeiro: Complexo do Alem√£o e Morro dos Prazeres. O programa j√° formou mais de 200 estudantes, muitos desses jovens j√° est√£o empregados na √°rea de tecnologia e inseridos em cursos de ensino superior. Al√©m de ser focado em linguagens de programa√ß√£o, o VNW dedica 25% do treinamento para o desenvolvimento de habilidades socioemocionais, onde os estudantes aprendem comunica√ß√£o n√£o-violenta, eleva√ß√£o coletiva e diversidade.

Articles first‚Ä¶  Digital Leaders Follow Digital Leaders -- Listen Share Written by Jason Turner, Director, Data2Action With nearly 25 years operational experience, I‚Äôve been lucky to lead some significant transformational change programmes. Whilst conventional thinking and previous experience have certainly played their part, my latter foray into industries and technology unknown, has often challenged my own approach and paradigms. Are previous experiences and knowledge a guarantee of future success or do Leaders need more ammunition? I think it‚Äôs safe to say that most of us recognise the unprecedented culture of change we now find ourselves in. Everyday emerging technologies are reforming and disrupting markets and this is placing new pressures on Leaders to act quickly to either protect their positions or seize new opportunities. Never has change been so pronounced and whilst choosing the right technology is a key driver to success, the ability and behaviour of the leader is often overlooked yet it is a critical success factor. Lack of clear vision and poor stakeholder engagement often results in some of the best solutions being relegated to the bin. As human beings, we have a tendency to rely heavily on our experiences, emotions and memories when analysing activity. When combined, these make up our perceptions and often shape our decision making. Combined with ‚Äòafter the event‚Äô management information, we all too often rely on our perceptions to help us predict what will happen in the future and use this to shape technology development. However in such a fluid and rapidly changing economy, relying on the past to predict the future simply isn‚Äôt enough. Where does this leave the Leader? As a species we are adept to change, and as we break new ground in terms of technological advancements, most would welcome the opportunity it brings. The birth of the internet was the platform to connect systems and as a result, we now find ourselves in a world where we are being presented with more and more data. Technology developments mean that the speed and variety in which this is being presented is relentless and as mere mortals, we simply cannot ingest this, thus the monumental rise of analytics. However data in its ‚Äònatural state‚Äô is often pretty worthless, it is the ability to question and harness the power of data that presents the greatest results. This is where businesses of the future are now flourishing. We are awash with research. 90% of the worlds data has been created in the last 2 years alone yet 80% of business data is going unused. Furthermore, research highlights that becoming more data centric leads to greater innovation, agility, opportunity and efficiency. However it has been found that most business decisions do not have a basis of fact (ie data) and thus we allowing our paradigms and perceptions to influence our decision. Are leaders truly making the transition from perception to data driven leadership? Its an old saying yet it is even more prevalent in todays world. Our team help business leaders solve specific problems such as using data to drive loyalty, improve efficiency, reduce costs or manage risks. However we consistently see the absence of basic data disciplines. Without available, accurate and actionable data sets, wisdom cannot be attained and such strategic imperatives will be left unsupported. In addition, in a world of digital transformation, the absence of effective data sets to help inform the leader often results in technology deployment that fails to deliver. How can you implement a solution when there was little clarity as to the specific objectives you were trying to achieve. We often see this in the implementation of CRM solutions. Often bought ‚Äòout of the box‚Äô, the provider gives a whole host of benefits but what does the Organisation wish to accomplish and are they all truly engaged? How many times do the solutions then fail to deliver and yet often the solution is to purchase further technology and the cycle begins again! So how do leaders make the transition and harness the value data can bring?

Member-only story Nick Kolakowski Follow Dice Insights -- 1 Share If you‚Äôve ever tried to develop a video game, you know it‚Äôs a tough process. For starters, it‚Äôs a programming challenge; and on top of that, you need to be creative enough to build something that folks actually want to play. With a new platform, Google is trying to abstract away much of the coding from game development, allowing developers to focus on the creative aspect. This platform, known as Game Builder, is still in prototype, but it shows how gaming could become the next tech segment to embrace the ‚Äúno- and low-code‚Äù paradigm. (It‚Äôs also similar in some ways to Grasshopper, Google‚Äôs user-friendly attempt to teach programming newbies the basics of JavaScript.) Game Builder relies on a visual programming system where you drag-and-drop cards in order to construct the game‚Äôs actions. Those with some programming knowledge can build customized cards with JavaScript, and there are APIs and 3D models so that you can populate your game‚Äôs environment with active characters and settings.

These recommendations will be incorporated into the CX Standards pending review and wider consultation. 1. Basic purpose of data sharing to be shared with the data holder Based on our research, we recommend that the data holder receive the basic purpose of data sharing as part of the authorisation request. The current understanding of revocation is that revoking data sharing would cancel any associated product/service. This recommendation will allow consumers to better understand the consequences of revoking authorisation, including which services/products they may be cancelling. We believe this would go some way in mitigating revocation confusion (which was an issue) and would provide a more informed experience than revoking authorisation to e.g. ‚ÄòaBank‚Äô with no context or other information. This recommendation is not in the Phase 1 CX Report but is being made in anticipation of further revocation needs; it is yet to be fully tested, but including the purpose of data sharing in Phase 1 Consent Flow testing did assist with comprehension during authorisation flows. This recommendation has been discussed with ACCC but needs to be considered further, including by information security professionals and the wider community. 2. Standardised communication of consent duration We recommend that the duration of consent be communicated in standardised time-based units e.g. x minutes, x hours, x days, x months. This recommendation is specific to ongoing consent, but the research indicates value for consent duration generally as participant interpretation of ‚Äòonce-off‚Äô and ‚Äòone-off‚Äô were very inconsistent. We also recommend that month-based consent durations align to calendar dates rather than number of days. For example, if consent was granted for 12 months on January 1st 2019, it should expire on January 1st 2020. 3. Provide multi-channel revocation Participants indicated they would overwhelmingly choose to revoke their consent via phone, in-person, or email. At present, digital dashboards are proposed as the only means of revocation. We recommend that data holders and data recipients provide non-digital and email channels as initial contact points that can then guide consumers to digital channels to complete the revocation process themselves. The research indicates this is an important recommendation that will make revocation accessible and allow consumers who may not be digital-first users, but may provide consent physically (e.g. facilitated in-person requests) to initiate revocation in their preferred manner. This will be especially important for building trust, CDR adoption, and to protect the reputation of CDR if any unexpected developments lead to consumers seeking consent revocation. 4. Provide multi-channel communications We recommend that data recipients and data holders provide additional communications to consumers such as a downloadable Consent Receipt, email confirmations, and other information including how to review and manage data sharing or where to go to raise a complaint or report misuses of data. This will allow consumers to have a verified source of truth rather than being required to recall or record the terms of their agreement themselves. These communications may form part of a notifications framework. 5. What to disclose at a minimum to satisfy the ‚Äòunambiguous disclosure‚Äô Rule (7.13(d)) There should be a clear understanding of what constitutes ‚Äòunambiguous disclosure‚Äô of data use. To satisfy the ‚Äòunambiguous disclosure‚Äô Rule (7.13d) research results favour that data recipients clearly state: 6. Accessibility We recommend that the Consent Model reflects the WCAG2.1 guidelines and/or the GOV.AU content guide, but recognise that further work needs to be done to develop an accessible Consent Model standard. Further work should include testing readability, keyboard-only use, screen readers, text to speech, and possibly extending CX Standards to include other accessible formats like visual aids. This work would extend to those who have delegates, require a translator, or are assisted/requested in person to provide consent digitally but may not be digital or English literate. 7. Next steps For Phase 1, the CX Workstream engaged with participants considered to be vulnerable or in vulnerable circumstances, including those in financial distress and those with accessibility needs. A diverse range of participants was sought so that a wide range of scenarios and needs could be better understood to inform the development of accessible CX Standards. While Phase 1 fulfilled many of the requirements for the Consent Flow, there are some known edge gaps in consumer representation, accessibility, scenarios, and other requirements that would benefit from deeper investigation to develop a comprehensive Consent Model. Recruited participants for Phase 1, for example, did not include many younger participants (under 29), and this was skewed towards those who had experienced financial distress, and late adopters of technology. This has given us insight into some of these more critical needs for the CDR, and addressing these will facilitate CDR adoption more widely. There is a potential benefit to recruiting more Early Adopters in any agreed upcoming work as they are expected to participate in the CDR regime first and will have needs for seamless integration. ACCC and Data61 are currently exploring the need to conduct further research based on the Phase 1 CX Report recommendations, broader considerations, and other program requirements. This will consider, where applicable, further research and testing for a version 2 of the Consent Flow (consent, authenticate, authorise), including any potential proposed redirect flows. Further work being considered is expected to explore consent/authorisation management and revocation, re-authorisation, joint accounts, 90 day notification(s), and communicating accreditation. This work may also expand to accommodate the energy and telecommunication sectors. Although it is not Data61‚Äôs remit, this research will inevitably generate insights about consumer trust and privacy that will be communicated outward. The CX Workstream is currently putting draft RFPs together to help identify further research and further validate the CX Standards; achieve additional consumer representation; provide standardised and necessary guidance on consent to data recipients and data holders; and facilitate consumer adoption of the CDR so its value can be realised. There will be a 2 week community consultation period that will close on Friday, March 15th at 5:00pm. Feedback received during this time will be considered for incorporation into a first draft of the CX Standards. You can provide feedback via email, specifying the document, page, and component you‚Äôre referring to; via comments on PDFs; or in comments on Google Docs. You can find links to these documents in the relevant sections above. Please provide concise and actionable feedback wherever possible, and focus on the validity of the recommendations and/or the implications of findings and recommendations. We also welcome feedback on the scope of this work, the focus, and the usefulness of these presentations. You can sign up to our mailing lists here; find past updates here; and find other information on the Consumer Data Standards website. The other technical workstreams also have an online presence on GitHub. If you would like to participate in any of our discussions across the four streams or provide any feedback, you can do so via email to cdr-data61@csiro.au.

As one of the world‚Äôs leading international financial centers, Hong Kong relies its economy on service-oriented businesses, as characterized by low taxation, almost-free port trade, and a well-established international financial market. Hong Kong‚Äôs global trading has been flourishing for being supported by its convenient supply chain industry, as well as its shipping and logistics type of business. In the late 20th century, Hong Kong was ranked as the seventh largest port in the world and second only to New York and Rotterdam in terms of container throughput. Not only well-known for its trading industry, Hong Kong is also popular for its tourism industry as it is one of the major pillars of the economy of Hong Kong. In 2016 alone, tourism industry contributed to around 5% of Hong Kong‚Äôs GDP and employed around 258.900 people, accounting for about 7% of total employment. In 2017, total visitor arrivals rebounded by 3.2% over 2016 to 58.5 million, of which overnight arrivals rose by 5.0%. The Mainland continued to be the largest source market of Hong Kong, accounting for around 76% of our visitors. The total number of visitors soared further by 9.6% in the first quarter of 2018 over the same period in 2017, mainly bolstered by 12.6% growth in Mainland arrivals. Tokoin aims to support the industrial sector with targeted utilization of its use cases. Particularly for Hong Kong, logistics and property use cases will be beneficial for MSMEs which often find it difficult to expand their business by opening a new branch and for business people who have the need for convenient access to their supply chain business needs. Tokoin can bring together the convenient ‚Äòmeet-the-needs‚Äô concept between Tokoin‚Äôs users and its partners. Providing easy access to business expansion opportunities, Tokoin can help its users obtain the credibility in a valuable data record as their collateral. As a platform which optimizes blockchain technology to establish a valid identity for and reputation of MSMEs, Tokoin offers a solution that allows Tokoin‚Äôs users to establish a trusted profile with security for all stakeholders in the ecosystem. Currently, in the world of MSMEs, there is one complex issue which cannot be solved easily, which is that the need for transaction data capture causes a roadblock in the MSMEs system itself. By leveraging blockchain which emphasizes on its decentralized capability to give incentives to users who contribute to the network, Tokoin plays its role by providing the correct data. The replication multitude of transactions could be made within minutes yet guarantee data integrity needed by MSMEs. This way, they could leverage their business in a sustainable way. By using blockchain, it also means that Tokoin implements encryptions that enable the system to transact faster but also more securely. Tokoin carries missions to help MSMEs in building a trusted profile with integrity, providing a virtual ledger for each user‚Äôs transaction, eliminating financial inclusion barriers, and increasing economic capabilities of the whole MSME ecosystem.

On the other hand, I was having trouble with my pace, and using a phone to track my runs was becoming cumbersome. Also, I knew that if I was going to get a running watch, built-in GPS would be an essential feature for me, which meant I‚Äôd be spending at least $100 on the watch. Last December, I finally decided to get one after they went on sale for Christmas. After six months of running with it, my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt buy one sooner. Even as a casual runner, the benefits of a running watch have been huge for me. The first thing that I noticed was that my runs were much more comfortable without lugging around my cellphone. I‚Äôve always liked tracking my runs, but before getting a running watch, this meant carrying my cellphone with me at all times so that I could use a tracking app. -- -- I‚Äôm a lawyer turned writer from North Carolina.

https://medium.com/hacksters-blog/flxo-is-a-tool-for-soft-robotics-exploration-d061602d8f34?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,FLXO Is a Tool for Soft Robotics Exploration,Written by Jeremy S. Cook,Jeremy S. Cook,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share As Amitabh Shrivastava puts it, soft robotics is an exciting emerging field where robotic actuators are made not from rigid materials, but are instead designed to flex and adapt to their surroundings under pneumatic or hydraulic control. Exciting, yes; but as this technology is in its infancy, if you want to tinker with soft robotics, you need to design your actuators, source materials, and actually fabricate your device, creating a bottleneck to exploration. To address this need, Shrivastava has created FLXO, a series of prefabricated soft actuators which can be constructed on a standard 3D printer. They‚Äôre meant to integrate directly into the VEX robotics system, though with 3D-printed adapters, one could presumably use them anywhere. A variety of motions are shown in GIF form on his website ‚Äî including a linear actuator, bending actuator, and devices that combine 45 or 90 degree twists with linear motion. Build details appear to be thin at this point, so hopefully they‚Äôll be revealed soon. If you‚Äôre wondering how to actually get pneumatic power to these soft robotic contraptions, he‚Äôs actually got a solution for that (almost) ready to go. As we reported earlier Shrivastava is now crowdfunding a Programmable Air platform that facilitates Arduino pneumatic control. -- -- New Posts on Substack: https://techadjacent.substack.com/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg"

One of the world‚Äôs largest financial companies, Alibaba subsidiary Ant Financial, recently introduced Shared Machine Learning (SML) as their solution for data privacy. Ant Financial has spent two years on the research and development of SML as a learning paradigm that can aggregate and process multiparty information while protecting the privacy of individual participants. Current data protection technologies are either based on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or Multiparty Computation (MPC) systems. TEE indicates a secure area for a third-party processor that protects data with confidentiality and integrity. Examples include SGX from Intel, SEV from AMD, and Trust Zone from ARM. MPC on the other hand is an emerging subfield of cryptography that jointly computes a function over data from different parties while keeping the data private. A recent example is federated learning, a distributed method Google introduced in 2017 to train models on a large corpus of decentralized data. Ant Financial‚Äôs SML solution combines TEE and MPC for applications in banking, insurance, and commerce. SML uses Intel‚Äôs SGX technology in its foundation layer and is compatible with other TEE implementations. The SGX-based SML method supports both online prediction and offline training. Online prediction models have a higher requirement for stability in load balancing, failover, and dynamic capacity expansion. One of the key technologies for improving stability is clustering, but conventional clustering solutions are not applicable on SGX. This prompted Ant Financial to design a new distributed online service framework as shown below. Unlike conventional clustering methods, in the SML framework each service will register and maintain a heartbeat connection with the ClusterManager (CM). This framework is able to: The framework supports a variety of commonly used prediction algorithms including LR, GBDT, and Xgboost; and enables prediction on encrypted data from multiple parties. In offline training, the SGX-based SML framework is compatible with Xgboost using LibOsOcclum and a home-grown distributed networking system to support data fusion and distributed training. Ant Financial is currently also using this solution to migrate TensorFlow. TEE-based shared machine learning on multiparty data works as follows: Ant Financial‚Äôs MPC-based SML framework has three layers: The MPC-based SML framework supports popular algorithms including LR, GBDT, GNN, etc. Below is the training process: The specific architecture of the training engine is shown below: Ant Financial also identified a couple of major differences between federated learning and shared machine learning: More information is available (in Mandarin) in this Ant Financial tech post.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system‚Äôs use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today‚Äôs global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth‚Äôs environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*slmYsWmKtV20cASx.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*slmYsWmKtV20cASx.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*slmYsWmKtV20cASx.jpg"
https://medium.com/@DirrtyFrank/few-years-more-b08b0f638e52?source=tag_archive---------186-----------------------,Few Years More‚Ä¶,Written by Franck Vinchon,Franck Vinchon,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Franck Vinchon Follow -- Listen Share Transhumanism is an international cultural/intellectual movement that aims to transform the human conditions by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance and transform human intellect and physiology. The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of post human beings. Julian Huxley came up with this word, animated by a family tendency to reinvent the future, with his brother Aldous. That may lead us to be defeating the odds of life for sure from now on, to beat death in the next steps. The human desire to acquire new capacities is as ancient as our species itself. We have always sought to expand the boundaries of our existence, be it socially, geographically or mentally. There is a tendency in at least some individuals always to search for a way around every obstacle and limitation to human life and happiness. We don‚Äôt even talk about all the eminent people that approached this theory through the centuries: Sumerians, Taoists, Greeks, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Isaac Newton, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, the Marquis de Condorcet and more recently Elon Musk, Dmitry Itskov, Ray Kurzweil and his boss Larry Page in the company Calico. Let‚Äôs be honest, the process is definitely in process, and limited only by the primitive nature of our existing interface tools ‚Äî our body capabilities for instance. We already carry around devices that collect and store all the information we need, supplement whatever lacks we may have and provide us with access to information sources from around the world in a snap. Quite naturally, this has raised the question of whether or not increasing reliance on such devices and applications is affecting our natural intelligence. A study at Columbia University demonstrated that subjects were significantly less likely to remember information that they knew they could easily access again using a search engine. Is this proof of diminishing mental capacity? Why commit to memory something you can easily access otherwise? Engineers and scientists may no longer be able to regurgitate many of the formula they use on a regular basis, but they don‚Äôt have to. Not if they understand what the results mean and how to apply them. Using media to amplify our capabilities has been going on ever since our distant ancestors. And certain skills may indeed be diminished when a new medium emerges to serve the same function with greater efficiency, much in the way that written histories supplanted the oral traditions of earlier cultures. Whether or not increasing reliance on digital media and mobile devices compromises our innate capabilities is a question no one can answer. Some people have a natural sense of direction; their capabilities may well be enhanced by the access to additional information. What ‚Äòsingularity‚Äô speaks to is bypassing the sensory interface tools we now employ in favor of direct access between the mind and digital media and possibilities. It‚Äôs pointless to grieve over the loss of learned skills once they have limited relevance. Infinitely more important is the potential impact that new and enhanced human capabilities will have on society. The most apparent of these will be the difference in ability between those with the desire and financial strength to embrace the new technology and those who do not. This divide will very likely be manifest along socioeconomic, religious and generational lines. Will those who refuse or lack the resources to take advantage of neural augmentation be able to coexist, let alone compete, with those who embrace it? Are we prepared to address the conflicts certain to arise when some members of society share this digital version of opportunities while others do not? What about the ability to perform complex calculations in seconds, or retrieve information instantaneously? Neural augmentation promises to level the playing field among those who accept it by compensating for individual cognitive deficits. Ironically, it also has the potential of creating an immense rift between those who enjoy its advantages and those who do not. As far as marketing fields is concerned, it is impossible to predict what effects singularity might have on communication. The first thing we understand is that ‚Äòimmortality‚Äô sells. The numerous companies created so far, all in different aspects of the evolution, are aiming to make incredible business along the way. But we need to admit that marketing is again slightly behind when you see all the evolution done so far. At its most basic level, marketers and advertisers concern themselves with instilling a particular message in the heads of people to whom it has relevance. We achieve this through the use of engagement and entertainment, and frequent exposure through a variety of media. How will ‚Äòsingularity‚Äô affect the way marketing agencies use media? Will it alter the ways in which advertisements are integrated with people‚Äôs existing information-gathering habits? With enhanced mental capacity and capability, and instantaneous access to global networks, will the concept of entertainment for those so enhanced change radically? Will mass media and digital advertising continue to be relevant for those with neural augmentation? Marketing and advertising will certainly continue to exist, but we will face larger issues to find the formats they take social and psychological change that result from the singularity. And we tend to forget about the brands themselves in this new paradigm that will definitely shape the next generation‚Äôs behaviors and beliefs. The brands will have to adapt to a new world, not only in the way they talk to people and deliver their messages but also in product development ‚Äî corporations will have to create new offers to match the new people‚Äôs expectations, we will have to dig deeper in micro-tribes depending on their new capabilities and advancements, the brands will have to change their promise to make sure their brands continue to be relevant to a new ‚Äòenhanced‚Äô world. And we don‚Äôt start to think now about the new brands or the new products that will have to address new needs, brands will have to adapt to this ‚Äòsuperhuman‚Äô world ‚Äî and maybe one day, facing the possibility to never die. Whether it happens soon or in hundreds years, the integration of enhanced human beings with marketing, advertising and media will clearly define the next stage in human evolution and establish the future direction of our socio-political and cultural systems. -- -- Founder Neon42, sports & entertainment-inspired marketing, brands and innovation consulting.

Whether it be through a car, a laptop, or even the device you are using to view this now, technology is so commonplace that it seems easy to forget the power these devices grant us are the press of a button. Anything that is computerized are created using semiconductors. Semiconductors are substances that conduct electricity and have partial properties of both conductors and non-conductors. These devices can be created individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits (IC). This is essentially the brain behind the hardware we use daily. The shrinking of semiconductors and transistors have powered the past 50 years of advances in computing ‚Äî but we have reached a point where such innovations are coming to a halt. Enter Moore‚Äôs Law. Moore‚Äôs Law is named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore. He observed in 1965 that transistors were shrinking so fast that every year twice as many could fit onto a chip, and in 1975 adjusted the pace to a doubling every two years. The chip industry has kept Moore‚Äôs prediction alive, with Intel leading the charge. And computing companies have found plenty to do with the continual supply of extra transistors. Intel announced their first stumble by pushing back its next transistor technology, with features as small as 10 nanometers, from 2016 to late 2017. Not only are there delays, but the company has also decided to increase the time between future generations. A technology roadmap for Moore‚Äôs Law maintained by an industry group, including the world‚Äôs largest chip makers, is being scrapped. Intel has suggested silicon transistors can only keep shrinking for another five years. What does this mean for you? Well Moore‚Äôs law is the essentially the reason why every new generation of smartphones and or laptops are thinner and faster than the previous. Without that constant innovation, our devices won‚Äôt have that new ‚Äúredesign‚Äù as often as we‚Äôve been receiving them. But not all is lost! To power the next generation of electronics, scientists are looking to rely on new concepts like quantum computing and neuromorphic computing. These technologies are able to perform computations in new ways that can be integrated theoretically or physically. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*tNzNKbt3m3wEABat.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*tNzNKbt3m3wEABat.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*tNzNKbt3m3wEABat.jpg"
https://medium.com/syncedreview/google-t5-explores-the-limits-of-transfer-learning-a87afbf2615b?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,Google T5 Explores the Limits of Transfer Learning,Published in SyncedReview,Synced,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Synced Follow SyncedReview -- 2 Listen Share A Google research team recently published the paper Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer, introducing a novel ‚ÄúText-to-Text Transfer Transformer‚Äù (T5) neural network model which can convert any language problem into a text-to-text format. The T5 model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on GLUE, SQuAD, and CNN/Daily Mail datasets; and scored an impressive 88.9 on the SuperGLUE language benchmark ‚Äî just a fraction short of the 89.8 human baseline. Paper Abstract: Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ‚ÄúColossal Clean Crawled Corpus‚Äù, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code. (arXiv) Synced invited Samuel R. Bowman, an Assistant Professor at New York University who works on artificial neural network models for natural language understanding, to share his thoughts on the ‚ÄúText-to-Text Transfer Transformer‚Äù (T5) framework. How would you describe the ‚ÄúText-to-Text Transfer Transformer‚Äù (T5) framework? T5 is an extremely large new neural network model that is trained on a mixture of unlabeled text (the authors‚Äô huge new C4 collection of English web text) and labeled data from popular natural language processing tasks, then fine-tuned individually for each of the tasks that they authors aim to solve. It works quite well, setting the state of the art on many of the most prominent text classification tasks for English, and several additional question-answering and summarization tasks as well. The most obvious new idea behind this work is that it is a text-to-textmodel: During training, the model is asked to produce new text as an output, even for training tasks that would normally be modeled as classification and regression tasks with much simpler kinds of output. However, this idea seems to have been chosen out of engineering convenience, and there‚Äôs no evidence that it‚Äôs necessary for the results they‚Äôve seen. Instead, what makes this work successful (and impressive) is that the authors took many of the best ideas from a number of recent works in NLP and did an extremely good job at rigorously testing and refining each idea as they added it. This yielded both a very well-tuned model and a lot of insights into the fine-grained design decisions that go into training a large general-purpose neural network on language. Why does this research matter? T5 represents the latest in a sequence of five or ten papers from the last couple of years on the same basic idea: training large neural networks on large amounts of unlabeled text, then fine-tuning them on labeled text for specific tasks. This series of papers has found that by refining and scaling that idea, we can achieve far better performance on most language understanding tasks than the typical NLP researcher might have thought possible. T5 claims the state of the art on more than twenty established NLP tasks. It‚Äôs extremely rare for a single method to yield consistent progress across so many tasks. That list includes most of the tasks in the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, which have caught on as one of the main measures of progress for applied language understanding work of this kind (and which my group helped to create). On many of these task datasets, T5 is doing as well as human crowdworkers, which suggests that it may be reaching the upper bound on how well it is possible to do on our metrics. What impact might this work bring to the field? I suspect that T5 will have a similar practical impact to many of the previous milestones in this line of work, like ELMo, OpenAI GPT, BERT, and RoBERTa: Many engineers who work on language understanding tasks in English will start to use a pretrained T5 model as a starting point for building systems, and many NLP researchers will work to identify and push past the limitations of the T5 model. Can you identify any bottlenecks in the research? From the perspective of researchers who want to use T5, its size is a huge obstacle: The full model is more than thirty times the size of established general-purpose NLP models like BERT, and these earlier models were already big enough to be difficult and expensive to use on commodity GPU hardware. I suspect that the existence of this model will help push more users toward Google‚Äôs Cloud TPU product, which was used for the experiments in the paper, and I suspect that there will be a great deal of work over the next year to try to reproduce this level of performance in smaller models. (Google‚Äôs ALBERT, which also came out recently, suggests some ways that we might make the target-task training process more efficient, and the NLP community has been increasingly interested in test-time model compression to speed up inference and better enable mobile applications.) From my perspective as someone interested in evaluation and fair competitions, the success of T5 presents another puzzle. Anyone who spends time using modern NLP systems, including systems built on other recent state-of-the-art networks like RoBERTa, will recognize that these systems are brittle, and often fail in un-human-like ways. Language understanding isn‚Äôt solved, even on well-studied languages like English, and even when we use tremendous resources. However, models like T5 are now showing human-level test set performance on most of the tests that the community has been using to measure understanding. If we want to be able to establish fair benchmarks that encourage future progress toward robust, human-like language understanding, we‚Äôll need to get better at creating clean, challenging, and realistic test datasets. Finally, and most importantly, models trained on large text datasets reliably learn a variety of human biases around things like race, gender, and nationality. For example, our SuperGLUE diagnostic tool (based on Winogender Schemas from Rachel Rudinger) shows that these models will often correctly classify sentences that involve stereotypical situations, like a a conversation between male doctor and a female nurse, but then fail on nearly identical sentences that break those stereotypes, like one with a female doctor and a male nurse. These biases mean that it‚Äôs often illegal or unethical to use models like T5 in products, or at least requires product engineers to do a great deal of difficult and task-specific debiasing work. Finding reliable and task-independent methods for reducing and controlling these biases is a huge open problem for NLP right now. Can you predict any potential future developments related to this research? This is a strange and exciting time to be working on NLP. The progress that we have made over the last few years has made it seem more and more urgent (and less and less crazy) to start talking about what it would mean to solvelanguage understanding. We clearly aren‚Äôt there yet, and it‚Äôs not possible to completelysolve language understanding without building a complete humanlike AI, but new building blocks like transformer neural networks, huge text datasets, and carefully-designed semi-supervised learning methods are starting to seem close. It doesn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôve yet hit the limits of how well these methods can do. The paper Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer is on arXiv. Related dataset, pre-trained models, and code are available here. About Prof. Samuel R.

I have been following the Flutter journey since its version of 0.10.2 but realized that I have not contributed to the Flutter community, yet. So I am more than intrigued to introduce a new article series ‚Äî Flutter Design Patterns. In the series, I will do my best to describe OOP design patterns, their implementation in Dart programming language and appliance when developing applications using Flutter. Update 2022‚Äì09‚Äì15: I moved this blog to my personal website. For a better reading experience, up to date articles, interactive code examples and some extra content FOR FREE, check kazlauskas.dev. In each article of the series, I will overview a design pattern, implement it using Dart programming language, prepare a practical (if possible) example in Flutter and add it to the Flutter Design Patterns mobile application. The theoretical part about design patterns would be heavily based on the ‚ÄúGang of Four‚Äù (GoF) book ‚ÄúDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software‚Äù, which, in my opinion, is one of the most iconic software engineering books about software design patterns. This book contains more than 20 different OOP design patterns, so you can expect more than 20 articles in the series! I will do my best to be consistent and publish a new article to the series weekly. Hmm, ok, maybe I have jumped straight to the point but did not explain what is this series about‚Ä¶ OOP stands for ‚ÄúObject-Oriented Programming‚Äù. In simple words, it is a programming paradigm that uses the idea of objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. This idea lets software engineers write code that represents the real-world objects, the data they contain and their relations with other objects via corresponding code structures. If you have already written some code using Dart or any other OOP programming language (C#, C++, Java just to name a few), probably you saw and used classes, defined properties and/or methods inside of those classes, created class instances and operated with them, specified relations between different objects/classes ‚Äî that‚Äôs nothing less than Object-Oriented programming! OOP design pattern is a typical solution to a common problem in software design. In the GoF book, the purpose of a design pattern is described like this: A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. A software design pattern is not about solving specific UI/UX problems (as it could look from first sight by noticing the word design), it is more about the code structure which is like a blueprint to solve a particular object-oriented design problem, issue in your code. By applying these patterns, you can speed up the development process, write code that is more flexible, reusable. However, the most difficult part of these patterns is to understand the main idea behind them, to identify places in your code where these patterns could be applied and which problems could be resolved. But that‚Äôs what this series is all about ‚Äî to introduce and provide the basics of several design patterns to help you choose the right one for your specific problem. As I have already mentioned, by introducing a new design pattern per article, I will also build a Flutter Design Patterns mobile application and expand its design patterns library step-by-step. Of course, this application is open-source and its code is already available on Github for all of you! The application consists only of three different screens ‚Äî the main menu, design patterns‚Äô category screen and design pattern‚Äôs screen. I hope you have noticed a little heartbeat animation in the main menu, as well as page transitions and content animations, which provide some dynamic to the application (I have spent a few hours implementing them, so, please, notice me senpai). To demonstrate how the application displays design patterns, I have created a new branch in the repository. I will not merge it to the master branch later (it is only for demonstration purposes), but by using these changes I will explain how a new design pattern could be (and will be!) added to the application. First of all, a new data object should be added to the assets/data/design_patterns.json containing information about the design pattern (id, title, description and route): Then a markdown file must be added to the assets/markdown folder with the same name as the previously set id in the design pattern‚Äôs JSON. This markdown would contain information about the design pattern ‚Äî usually, code snippets with some explanation on how the pattern is implemented. After providing a markdown file, the design pattern should be implemented and its example widget for the design pattern‚Äôs screen should be prepared. For this example, I have created a simple Hello World widget (introduction.dart): Finally, a new route should be added to router.dart file by adding the route name to the DesignPatternRoutes class (it should match with the route value in the design pattern‚Äôs JSON file) and adding a new DesignPatternDetails widget with a previously created example (lines 25‚Äì32): That‚Äôs all! After these steps, a new design pattern is available in the Flutter Design Patterns library: If I have missed something, do not hesitate to ask or just check the code by yourself, it is open and free for use!

But now, staring at the ceiling or scribbling in a journal is replaced by a constant stream of carefully curated social media feeds, which can be confusing for teens in that tricky developmental stage of identity formation. Can technology, the very thing contributing to these feelings of inadequacy and FOMO, help young people cope? At PCMag, we‚Äôve tested a few emotionally aware concepts, from the listening network 7 Cups and an AI trained on relationship drama to Facebook Messenger and cartoon penguin therapists. More recently, we checked out Blue Fever, a service that sends mood-mending video texts on demand. A Techstars graduate, Blue Fever is currently part of USC‚Äôs Viterbi Startup Garage, an early-stage incubator for deep technology and AI-enabled companies. Here‚Äôs how Blue Fever works: Once you‚Äôve signed up, all you do is SMS your #mood to the service, and its AI tries to get you back on track with funny, empowering, enlightening, or just downright mad moments. We tried it, and it‚Äôs like having a friend (with some serious machine learning in its non-bio-based cortex) who doesn‚Äôt mind being bothered with your stuff at 4 a.m. We spoke with co-founders Lauren Tracy and Greta McAnany to find out more. Here are edited and condensed excerpts from our conversation. Lauren and Greta, what‚Äôs the concept behind Blue Fever? [GM] Over the past few years, we‚Äôd both noticed that the internet is moving from search-based retrieval, then social media browsing, to a more self-medicating, always-on consumption experience. We all spend hours binging on Netflix or mindlessly scrolling through our IG feeds, but this behavior isn‚Äôt conscious. We‚Äôre all looking for something, but not finding it. [LT] So we wanted to build an AI platform that provides an on-demand emotionally satisfying solution. Especially to underserved audiences, like teens and young women, who really need positive images to build confidence. [GM] We launched in June 2017, pivoted our business model and focus through incubation at Techstars, and are now building out our product, platform, and growing the audience. Blue Fever is a personal AI that delivers cool content? [GM] Yes. And the emphasis is on ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù ‚Äî not ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs an important distinction. Browsers can track my cookies and see what I‚Äôm watching, buying, or doing, and target ads at me. But that‚Äôs not really personal. Good point. The ads Google serves to me make me laugh (mostly). But when I tried out Blue Fever, I texted my #mood (#meh, as it happened to be) and got something which did, in fact, make me smile.  [LT] And you didn‚Äôt have to search for it. Blue Fever‚Äôs AI knows what to serve up. An empathetic but not a therapy AI? [GM] Right. Because, sure, Blue Fever might be therapeutic, but we‚Äôre not building a therapy tool. Our empathetic AI is more like a good, slightly older friend who curates the internet for you, based on your self-reported emotional state. Explain how you‚Äôre training the Blue Fever AI algorithm. [LT] We looked at whether we wanted to pull from other models, other curation types, particularly from other industries like music, gaming, movies. Then we realized that we needed to build our own. [GM] Mostly because so much of the work done to date isn‚Äôt aimed at our primary audience due to input bias. [LT] Right. Our Blue Fever formula is conversational AI, scaled off of the Dialogflow platform, developed at Google. We started with human-to-human interaction, feeding the neural net with IRL messaging, chat, talk, responses; teaching the AI the right 13- to 20-year-old female vernacular, and letting it learn from there. Authenticity is key. When I interviewed Stanford professor Dr. Alison Darcy, founder of Woebot, she talked about ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù her AI on geek speak like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica so 20-something young males could relate.  [GM] Absolutely. Our value system is built entirely on the trust of our users. We don‚Äôt have a product without that. [LT] The technology enables us to build this trust, but it learns from human input and is constantly undergoing validation. Your AI platform is ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù then? Constantly monitored by bio-based beings to make sure Blue Fever is communicating properly? [LT] Actually, instead of ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop AI,‚Äù we call it ‚ÄúHai‚Äù [for] human artificial intelligence. You incubated Blue Fever at Techstars. What did you learn most there about running a startup?  [GM] Techstars was a real turning point for us as entrepreneurs. I like to say we went in as ‚Äúmedia founders,‚Äù because our original business model was about creating content, but we emerged from Techstars as true tech founders. Our mentors there, particularly Anna Barber [Managing Director, Techstars LA], kept hammering this message home to us: ‚ÄúThink about the problem in a new way, use tech to solve it.‚Äù [LT] So we did. And by the time we left Techstars, we‚Äôd evolved Blue Fever from a content play into a messaging platform with an AI component. We were in Anna‚Äôs first cohort of early stage companies, and she treated like us tech entrepreneurs from day one. ‚ÄúYou have a clear grasp of the problem, and a vision for how to solve it, and I‚Äôm going to bet on you,‚Äù [she said]. Her attitude made all the difference. Aside from your support from USC Viterbi Startup Garage, who are your investors and what was it about your elevator pitch that they really got? [GM] We have several early-stage investors. When Jesse Draper, founding partner of Halogen Ventures, heard our pitch about delivering personal messaging using AI, she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to fix the problems in the media industry, I‚Äôm in.‚Äù Another big supporter is BlueRun Ventures. They liked our approach towards Gen Z, and their emotional lives. Their feedback was along the lines of: ‚ÄúWe see these two founders and they‚Äôre passionate and hungry. We‚Äôre going to back them.‚Äù How much did they give you, and what‚Äôs your revenue model? [LT] We‚Äôre not ready to talk numbers yet. We will ‚Äî hopefully in Q1 2020. Right now, we‚Äôre focusing on scaling up the product and getting it right. Can you share sign-up figures, or is too early for that too? [GM] What we can say, right now, is we‚Äôve got users in all 50 states and have handled a volume of 3 million messages via our platform. Short-form content is becoming a ‚Äúthing‚Äù in Hollywood now, not just inside YouTube. According to sources, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman are looking to spend $1 billion on ‚Äúbite-sized‚Äù items by 2025 at Quibi. [GM] The transition makes sense. Our lives have changed as services have become automated. For example, I used to drive everywhere, now I use rideshare. I used to cook, now I get delivery. We‚Äôre left with small moments which are perfect for short-form content. [LT] Which makes it even more important to have those small content moments curated especially for you, and for how you‚Äôre feeling. Are you expanding your core product to go further than teens/young women? [GM] Not right now. But that is the eventual goal. We are focused on building this for young women because they‚Äôre underserved with good, confidence-building, mood-mending content right now. And, as a business we want to start with a clear target market to differentiate ourselves. Finally, what‚Äôs next for you?  [LT] We‚Äôre heading to SXSW soon to speak on a panel on the tech, industry and enterprise track [on March 9]. [We‚Äôve been before but] this is our first time going as ‚Äútech co-founders.‚Äù [GM] Which feels really cool.

Shecter,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in James R. Shecter Follow -- Listen Share Note: I first learned of the following series of facts from Tom Friedman‚Äôs ‚ÄòThank You for Being Late‚Äô (which I‚Äôve ranted about before)‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôve heard me relay these before (note: I was, and still am, so amazed by this that I initially shared with damn near anyone who would listen), trust me it‚Äôs worth another read and an additional ponder‚Ä¶ SO, we know China is a far more technologically advanced society than the US. From its Black Mirror-esque surveillance state to its use of e-payment services (AliPay, WePay, and other near-Venmo equivalents), they leave us in the dust in far more tech-centric domains than is comfortable to admit. Double-clicking on the cashless aspect for a second, consider this: I‚Äôve seen estimates that 45‚Äì65% of daily transaction volume in China runs through those e-payment services. Regardless of where exactly the proportion is, it dwarfs that of the United States which is circa-20% max. Day-to-day, people in China aren‚Äôt even carrying around wallets anymore; they‚Äôre just using QR codes on their phone to scan and pay. And just about every merchant, ranging from a luxury store to a bodega-type market, has a QR code for customers to scan on their phones to shuffle money through the ether to where payments are due. Naturally, Chinese street beggars caught on, and now they‚Äôre often seen carrying QR codes linked to their own accounts, so that a prospective passer-by can scan and send quickly rather than fumbling awkwardly for a wallet, bill, or change. Even beggars in China recognize the benefits of efficient payment systems! That blew my mind in itself, but that‚Äôs not it‚Ä¶ The craziest part of this anecdote is what the beggars do once they‚Äôve collected a few dozen QR codes from passerbys‚Äô donations. As Friedman explains, these beggars then turn around and flip the lists to data-hungry merchants/brands, so those companies can better target their inventory and advertising to the local demographic (by cross-referencing the ‚Äúanonymized‚Äù profiles of QR Codes). THINK ABOUT THAT! Chinese beggars are jockeying for positions in front of higher-end companies NOT JUST because they have more affluent clientele but because THOSE COMPANIES ARE MORE DATA HUNGRY AND THUS WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR LISTS OF BEGGAR-COLLECTED QR CODES! Beggars in China carving out an intermediary position in a newly created market. Data is the new gold, new oil, new everything‚Ä¶ Holy... A few of the pieces below ‚Äî about how anonymized data isn‚Äôt really anonymized, how the US being on its way towards a cashless society , how drop-shipping can be wildly profitable, the daily grinds of food app deliverymen ‚Äî re-summoned the significance of this anecdote. There are entirely new markets, arbitrage opportunities, middlemen, etc. springing up as a result of the ‚Äòdynamic interconnectedness‚Äô that epitomizes the contemporary business landscape. Opportunities arise with dizzying frequency for small niches and large TAM prospects alike, and people/business/ideas jump on those prospects even faster. So how do we keep up and stay current, so as not to become instantaneously outdated in our worldview and skillset? ‚ÄúBy reading Content Lists like this, of course!‚Äù James typed cheekily.

That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre in a growing phase and trying to implement a sustainable business model to survive in the industry. This is the era of Digital Transformation, it‚Äôs continuously evolving and here‚Äôs how Creatrixe adapted to it. Developing an agile mindsetTempering with corporate culture is one of the most difficult things to change but since startups are developing hence it‚Äôs still malleable. Some companies often fall short of growing, because the top tier in the corporate hierarchy is focused on numbers. Ther sole focus is on quantifiable metrics like Return on investment in a certain category. Creatrixe understood that it is just as important to invest resource in a culture that nourishes an agile mindset, as it is to invest in anything else. The management should be committed to digital transformation to build employees‚Äô skill and competence. Communication is the keyBuilding an inclusive environment is also important so before the big launch, get employees in the loop. Create a ‚Äúget-through-guide‚Äù or make time to explain processes to employees on ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù the company is implementing digital transformation and be open to suggestions; another way is to create a communication platform. We encourage employees to be a part of the launch of any project. Build a team from across the company to deliver it. Use Open Source TechnologyWe understood that the best way to adopt digital transformation is to adopt open source technology like cloud computing, Deep machine learning, real-time analytics etc. These solutions are cheaper than intractable software licensing agreements. The combination of operations and innovation will prove to be a catalyst for transformation even if maintaining sustainable business operations is a priority. Customer is KingRemember: Customer and CRM are the two most important critical factors for your business. If you want to be the top option for your customers, you have to make them the center of every decision you make. The bigger companies have transformed through data-driven action. They have included inferred data from interactions with their customers in their corporate culture. This helps in understanding the customer more. We optimize user experience and keep it in mind while executing any related task and make an inventory of the data. Be it their comments on a certain design or the functionality of a certain API. It seems difficult and time-consuming but it is necessary to learn and grow. TransparencyMake the customer experience and feedback transparent to the people involved. It‚Äôs more difficult in a bigger company when sensitive and confidential data is involved. But if regulated data (which is necessary to share) is disclosed to stakeholders, it can help your transformation journey like ours. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*5BT-RZEZPCmpJLoe.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*5BT-RZEZPCmpJLoe.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*5BT-RZEZPCmpJLoe.jpg"
https://medium.com/@mirandafm/in-defence-of-quibbling-tech-ethics-process-not-principles-268784e97931?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,In defence of quibbling‚Äî tech ethics process not principles,Written by Miranda Marcus,Miranda Marcus,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Miranda Marcus Follow -- Listen Share The other day I was listening to an episode of Revisionist History podcast by Malcolm Gladwell about 16th Century maritime insurance and baseball doping. The connection he drew was pretty tenuous. But it was interesting. Essentially Gladwell explores the method of Casuistry for solving ethical dilemmas for new problems. Casuistry is a process of reasoning created by the Jesuits. A very brief synopsis of this method would be that one examines this novel problem not by applying general moral principles, but by establishing a ‚Äòstandard case‚Äô (the word casuistry derives from the Latin noun casus meaning ‚Äúcase‚Äù or ‚Äúoccurrence‚Äù), which has a clear moral outcome. One then creates a rigorous taxonomy to define where the similarities lie and where the points of difference are. Essentially it is comparative analysis for ethics. It‚Äôs also used as a kind of philosophical slur to imply quibbling and equivocation in the face of tough moral decisions, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to phase Malcolm. He spends the episode applying the casuist method to a famous baseball doping scandal looking at how one evaluates modern growth hormone technologies in comparison to traditional surgical techniques. In the process, he demonstrates what it is to equivocate in an applied and compellingly practical manner. More specifically, he demonstrates how the casuist method can be used to inform on the morality of new problems. Now, I‚Äôm not about to pretend I really know anything about moral philosophy, and I definitely don‚Äôt know anything about Jesuits, but listening to the episode made me reflect on the current state of conversations relating to the risk of new technologies manifesting unintended negative consequences. We are facing a whole load of NEW and juicy problems. Problems like how to effectively moderate the line between freedom of speech and hate speech or how to deal with deepfakes. We have never encountered these problems in these ways before. So far, we have pretty much produced a stream of endlessly similar yet slightly rivalrous sets of principles which are then pretty unilaterally criticised for being too general and therefore not very useful. Gladwell makes the solid point that when it comes to a new problem, you can‚Äôt solve it by speaking to a principle. Principles don‚Äôt help because they are the product of past experience. In a new situation, you‚Äôre in uncharted territory and therefore you must proceed on a case by case basis. A general rule applies generally and the more you descend into the particulars, it is no longer a general rule. Take, for example, the problem of virtual reality‚Äôs psychological impact. Studies indicate that experiencing a VR simulation in an avatar which is of a different race to ones own can have a dramatic impact on the users racial bias, as in they were less bias to other races. Of course immersing your two primary cognitive senses entirely obviously has a profound neurological experience! This is why VR can be so effective as a treatment for PTSD and potentially have many other incredibly positive uses, but also could be preset a risk for misuse, manipulation and abuse. One of the largest commercial audiences for VR technologies are children and adolescents playing video games whose brains are highly plastic and responsive. Having a technology which is potentially this emotionally powerful is a new problem but VR is like any tool- it can be used well or not so well. It‚Äôs not about banning the tool, it‚Äôs about understanding the risk, uses, and impacts in an applied manner. So whilst I am not saying there is no value in the principles work, we don‚Äôt need any more principles, we need to get our hands dirty. We need to foreground the critical method for understanding and evaluating the development and use of new technologies. Unilateral notions of good and bad won‚Äôt cut it. Finding and developing ways that we can consistently and transparently understand these new problems is of vital importance. There are hundreds of years of moral philosophy and critical methods for understanding the world, so let‚Äôs use that knowledge. -- -- Acting Head BBC News Labs / Wellcome Trust Data For Mental Health Research. ex Open Data Institute.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/healthcare-5-0-from-codes-to-clinic-35023cbe1f1e?source=tag_archive---------123-----------------------,Healthcare 5.0 ‚Äî from Codes to Clinic,Published in DataDrivenInvestor,Medgic,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Medgic Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Artificial Intelligence (AI) is indeed the transformational technology of our generation, and whilst its practicality in Healthcare is still yet to be fully felt ‚Äî real-life deployment and funding of promising AI startups are ever-growing. We predict that within the decade, Artificial Intelligence would be recognized as a complementary arm of healthcare ‚Äî and while it might not fully replace the traditional role of professionals, AI certainly can disrupt healthcare to become better, faster, cheaper and more accessible. The benefits of Medical AI in unprivileged communities cannot be overstated. AI could save lives (and your pockets) on a global scale. So in this emerging evolution from codes to clinic, which are the movers and shakers in this promising industry? We examine a few as they will, de facto, shape our future. https://aimi.stanford.edu/ Stanford University Stanford, California United States of America [Status] R&D-in-progress, Private University What they are working on: Radiology Deep Learning, Data Augmentation, X-ray/plain film analysis, volumetric film analysis Why they are promising: Stanford is a world-renowned higher learning institution with her own medical facilities. Comprising a famous faculty including the likes of Prof Curtis Langlotz, Stanford also has immense funding, manpower to fund their cutting edge research. Particularly impressive is the fact that Stanford organizes her own Medical Imagenet though the dataset is not yet made available to the public. Potential challenges: Deep Learning for radiology is perhaps not the easiest domain to tackle. The very fact that many radiology models require a volumetric assessment (eg: CT/MRI) and may not be clinically significant if interpreted by frame means that Stanford AIMI has quite a battle. Labeling in radiology is also another pandora box. Consolidation or frank pneumonia? To tackle this, Stanford AIMI will probably need to standardize and protocolize these labelings. 2. Medical Good Intelligence Company (MEDGIC) https://www.medgic.coMEDGIC East Coast Road Singapore [Status] Active, Non-Profit, Private Startup (Independent) What they are working on: Dermatology Deep Learning, Bayesian Network, Skin analysis, Skin Diagnosis, Skin Scanning, Detection of skin conditions Why they are promising: Probably the first and only on earth to tackle the entire spectrum of dermatological conditions (with pretty impressive accuracy for a start), Medgic is a non-profit startup which has resisted funding and to date remains strictly independent. It is made in Singapore by a team of doctors and computer scientists. The founder, Dr. R Lim has stated that funding from private funds ‚Äúwould make Medgic chase money‚Äù but ‚Äúthe real ROI is the number of lives we could change.‚Äù While Medgic is not rated as a medical device nor does it claim to be diagnostic or have any medical accuracy yet (pending clinical trials which would require larger funding), it is released as a general skin scanner, detector and analyzer to ‚Äúprovide general information for general purposes only‚Äù. Potential challenges: Being independent and small, the team will have a harder time marketing itself and making the technology known to the remote corners of the world. Language barriers are probably the next big challenge ‚Äî Medgic AI actually asks users about their skin condition ‚Äî and medical terminologies often are hard to translate. This is especially true as Medgic is trying to target unprivileged communities with poor access to healthcare. 3. Google AI https://ai.google/healthcare Google Mountain View, California United States of America [Status] R&D-in-progress, Private Corporation What they are working on: Retinography Deep Learning, Pathology Deep Learning Why they are promising: Google AI is no doubt the grandfather of Artificial Intelligence innovations. The world stood in awe as AlphaGo beat Kai Jie in the ancient Chinese game of Go back in 2017. Since then the team has been working on meaningful applications such as medical imaging (as above). The sky is indeed the limit for Google. Potential challenges: Pathology is an important area to disrupt but this field is relatively operator dependent. For example, pathology slides may differ significantly depending on the operator‚Äôs choice of, amount and combination of staining. Retinography similarly requires the use of a complex machine which many professionals might still not be skilled at. That being said, these are surmountable challenges which can be tackled over time. -- -- empowerment through data, knowledge, and expertise. subscribe to DDIntel at https://ddintel.datadriveninvestor.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*5xl35ZZ8TYGxjvM_, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*5xl35ZZ8TYGxjvM_, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*5xl35ZZ8TYGxjvM_"

https://medium.com/@marinagen/smart-city-technology-will-make-your-kids-and-parents-healthier-9bd51117736a?source=tag_archive---------117-----------------------,Smart healthcare could be coming soon,Written by Marina G,Marina G,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Marina G Follow -- Listen Share Smart City Technology Will Make Your Kids and Parents Healthier Smart city technology can help us to exercise more, schedule doctor appointments with an AI, and warn about infection outbreaks. In the age of active disruption, the healthcare industry seems really outdated. You can get a self-driving car, pay for stuff with contactless cards or even without them ‚Äî thanks to face recognition, learn almost any skill online, but you can‚Äôt rely on technology to save you time or effort when going to the doctor. Skipped appointments and forgotten medication pick-ups are a common problem. Instead of feeling guilty about it, I decided to explore how smart cities are already solving or can potentially solve this problem. I wish someone could fix healthcare, it‚Äôs probably the biggest market we haven‚Äôt had any impact on ‚ÄúI wish someone could fix healthcare, it‚Äôs probably the biggest market we haven‚Äôt had any impact on‚Äù, ‚Äî said Gil Penchina, who was an angel investor behind Paypal, LinkedIn, Ripple, and many other successful startups, in an interview with an amazing Youtube-blogger, Silicon Valley Girl. What has changed in the healthcare industry so far? Yet the processes of appointment scheduling, doctor visits, and regular health checkups remain extremely outdated and time-consuming. A Philadelphia-based Hahnemann Hospital has attempted to improve this. A few years ago, they ran an experiment where 350 congestive heart failure patients were encouraged to download an app that sent them reminders about follow-up appointments via texts and email messages. As a result, the readmission rate for these patients improved by 10%, which was a success. Now imagine that there is a centralized app that keeps track of all your follow-up doctor‚Äôs appointments, regular health checkups, and health test results. The app is connected to your doctor‚Äôs office, and your family doctor is able to add health recommendations or additional checkups to the list. This technology can save doctors‚Äô offices and hospitals hours of time on reminders and phone calls, and it can save you hours of time as well. Many follow-up appointments won‚Äôt be necessary as the doctor will be able to share their recommendations through the app. Let‚Äôs look at this as an example: Meet Jane, a busy mom of a 2-year old, trying to balance her career and take proper care of her child. Recently, she started experiencing frequent headaches, so she goes to the doctor and the doctor thinks it may be caused by a low hemoglobin level in her blood. So he sends Jane for a blood test. The blood test confirms light anaemia. Now, instead of booking Jane in for a follow-up appointment, the doctor uses the app to issue her a prescription. Jane sees her test results and her doctor‚Äôs conclusion immediately, so at lunch time she goes to the nearest drug store and buys the prescribed iron supplements ‚Äî all without the need to even call the doctor‚Äôs office or visit it again. Taking it to the next level, the city-wide healthcare app can get information about available appointments in hospitals and filter out the best options for you, relying on the AI algorithm. This basically eliminates the need to think about making those appointments, freeing up a lot of time and mental space in your head. Let‚Äôs go back to Jane. Now she needs to get her son in for a regular dental checkup. Overloaded with her work tasks and household chores, she has forgotten to schedule an appointment well in advance. Now her dentist is saying she is fully-booked. So Jane has two options: postpone the appointment for at least a month or look for other dentists which are available. With an app that relies on smart city technology, this process could be a lot simpler. Once the reminder is triggered, the software would automatically locate clinics close to the regular route from Jane‚Äôs home to the daycare center, ping them for available time slots around the time of Jane‚Äôs regular commute, and then deliver the best options to Jane. Instead of getting a reminder to call the doctor, Jane would get a list of the most suitable appointments pre-selected by the artificial intelligence in her app. Now she can book the most convenient one for her and her son right there on the app. Smart sensors can also be installed in the homes of people with certain health conditions to help identify unusual behavior. Jane‚Äôs husband, Rob, is worried about his older mom living alone. Like many adults, Rob doesn‚Äôt call her very often, but it doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt care. So one day he convinces his mom to install a smart sensor. The sensor can monitor her behavior and surrounding environment. If it detects the smell of food in the evening, it automatically reminds her to take her prescribed medication ‚Äî the one that needs to be taken at dinner time. If the sensor detects low or unusually high activity levels in the room, it will send an alarm signal to Rob‚Äôs phone and to the doctor‚Äôs office. When Rob receives this alert, he calls his mom to make sure she is OK. Soon the phone starts sending such alerts every few days. On the 10th alert the app automatically detects that such behavioral changes could be an early sign of Alzheimer‚Äôs, and advises Rob‚Äôs mom to consult a doctor. The doctor can then assess the information from the sensor, talk to the patient and make his conclusion as to whether further health inspections are needed. Luckily, Rob‚Äôs mom is fine, she just was a little stressed about her upcoming trip to her friend‚Äôs in Louisiana. But Rob can have peace of mind knowing that his mom is getting the attention and medical care she needs. On a city level, information from millions of centralized healthcare apps on citizens‚Äô phones can be used to improve city design to make citizens healthier. There is a parameter called ‚Äòneighborhood walkability‚Äô.A good neighborhood has a high level of walkability, encouraging citizens to be more physically active. Walking to a favorite restaurant, a grocery store, a playground, or a daycare center instead of taking a drive is a great way to add some exercise to a daily routine. With mass adoption of wearable devices, city architects can get very precise information about how citizens navigate through neighborhoods. Analyzing large sets of data can help get a real picture and take city design to the next level in terms of neighborhood walkability. Smart sensors can also play a great role in identifying air quality issues and taking preventive measures. One cost-effective idea is to install air quality sensors on to existing fixtures, such as street lights. The authorities in Louisville, Kentucky have taken a more interesting approach to improving citizens‚Äô health. The city was ranked the 16th most challenging city for people with asthma in the US. So they issued asthma inhalers with built-in sensors. Every time the device is used, the location was detected and stored in the database. This helped the city create a map of asthma hotspots: places where asthma incidents happened most often. By analyzing this data, the authorities realised that air quality on certain streets in the centre was the potential cause. So they added additional trees and plants to those streets. The results were worth it: the number of asthma incidents in the area has decreased by 60%. Similar technology can be used to identify other problematic areas and locations with outbreaks of viruses. Jane and her 2-year-old son plan to go to a playground in the park. She has no idea that there is a burst of gastro infection in the neighborhood. Wearables of 10 recent patients show that they have been frequently playing on the same playground. For the next 24 hours, the area will be highlighted on the map as potentially dangerous. Just before leaving the house, Jane checks the city health map on the phone and realizes she needs to change plans to ensure her child doesn‚Äôt get the virus. Data transmitted from wearable devices can also be used to more quicklyr identify the location of large accidents that could endanger a lot of people. If there is an abrupt change in the health indicators of many people, it could signal an issue and help the emergency services to react faster. Smart healthcare technology seems to offer great benefits, but those benefits come at a cost. Having data from smart wearables constantly transmitted to healthcare providers and emergency services means the complete end of privacy (although our privacy is dead anyway). Not to mention government agencies which can access information from our devices at any time ‚Äî they are powerful enough to get such information from anyone they want to, even without smart sensors. Hackers can also break into your home data sensors to assess when you leave the house and for how long, and use this information to gain access. Other dangers linked to compromised privacy may also arise. Before smart healthcare goes mainstream, we need to find a way to safely store and protect this data. A combination of blockchain and biometric protection may one day become powerful enough to do this, but for now we simply don‚Äôt have this technology ready. Gil Penchina calls healthcare one of the top three most promising startup markets. Let‚Äôs hope that he is right and wait for real disruptors in the healthcare system. For the guys that will help Jane take a break from worries about her missed doctor‚Äôs appointments and playground viruses. The guys that will help Rob make sure his mom is doing well, even though he forgot to call her on Sunday. The guys that will use smart city technology to adapt the healthcare system to our fast-paced mobile lifestyle. Hopefully it won‚Äôt take long. -- -- Explaining blockchain and crypto to ‚Äònormal people‚Äô | Fintech Writer https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgeneralova/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*a2bmiofiUO6jQIGDc5HtaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*a2bmiofiUO6jQIGDc5HtaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*a2bmiofiUO6jQIGDc5HtaA.jpeg"

B2B market itself consists of a different market and the power is not in the hands of the B2B owner but in the hands of the buyer or retailer. The challenges a B2B owner faces are quite different from what a normal businessman faces. So all the people who are into any type of B2B business needs to understand all the challenges which they might face during their B2B journey. Here are a few points to consider. 1. Technology ‚Äî Boon or Bane Technology has not just created doors for development and success but has created an atmosphere of competition and stress. The people who have been able to explore it completely are striving and the progress graph is going upwards. The businessmen who are using SEO, SEM, using a website, visibility on social media and many more are going on a track which is called success. But there are many more tools which people use like Customer Relationship Management(CRM), Analytics of company and many more small tools of technology. B2B companies often find it difficult using all this technology in comparison to B2C who make every single effort to make sure that the customer comes back to them as soon as possible. 2. Diversion of Focus From Basics In B2B business what actually matters is how much you are able to earn from the sales as sometimes technology might close some gates of sales. This is a reason why till date many B2B companies are still using their golden rule of business meaning their own strategies. The basic understanding of how your marketing strategies are going to affect your sales is the first rule of business, if you are able to understand that your strategies are taking your sales graph upward then only you are going to flourish. When you deal with a buyer many times technology might not be able to help you. Also tracking the different departments of your company is important, a coordinated team can do wonders beyond imagination. 3. Right Strategy For Each Stakeholder In a B2B business buying decisions is often the most crucial decision as in this decision the number of stakeholders involved is many. As B2B business is not one way, it becomes important for the company to make itself visible differently in front of different people meaning a different image, content for influencers and different for stakeholders. With this change in role and responsibilities so many chances of error also increases. In order to tackle this situation a little smoothly, one needs to make sure that marketing and sales work hand in hand.

The premier Security system is effectively work in necessary to consider a large number of the details, observing from facility design, to observe from the possible attack ranges, the ways of intruding and the availability of intruding through the fencing and its designed elements and also observation of the surrounding. In most of the systems the details of the observations can only be found through the website research these observations are taken by the operations to make the safety of the periphery of a complete place or building. In the protection of a building, there are some necessary conditions that there must be a complete system, which observes automatically the surroundings with the most advanced techniques of detection. There is some kind of security systems available in the market and one of them is Hydra, which works for thermal detection and surveillance. Thermal Radar is commonly used a best in class for rotating and applies edge-based on analytic identification, classify and locate any invasion that may threaten your perimeter. Thermal Radar detection alerts generate not only to identify the intruder‚Äôs specific location but also a thermal image of the intrusion. By providing accurate detection, Thermal Radar provides many of the same specific results of traditional radar while remaining a completely passive and undetectable intrusion system. Thermal Radar can be a standalone detection outpost on an expansive border project or the centerpiece of an integrated physical security strategy at your most difficult facilities. Thermal Imaging is used for wide-area intrusion detection. The thermal imaging is a highly sensitive and advanced system, which detects the intrusion, with a small change in the climate. Thermal Imaging radar can rotate up to 360 angles. It can prevent commercial, industrial harm and it can be used for data storage in warehouses. It can remotely and passively monitor and protect your facilitates, whether it‚Äôs a large facility, single asset, onshore or offshore.

Meditation and mindfulness have been all the rage recently. There‚Äôs a rise in the practice, and with that comes a rise in the number of apps which promise you peace and happiness. But do these apps work, or do we trick ourselves into thinking they make a difference? As you might‚Äôve guessed, it‚Äôs a complicated answer. And there‚Äôs no peace or happiness that you‚Äôll find at the end of the article ‚Äî these are only some of the views that I have. The most popular form of meditation is ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù, or ‚ÄúVipassana‚Äù. The practice aims to train the meditator to be able to be aware of their own thoughts and emotions. We‚Äôve all got an endless stream of thoughts flowing through our minds. We‚Äôre unaware of a majority of these thoughts. The issue with these thoughts is this: a good chunk of these thoughts are negative in nature. Without knowing it, these thoughts put us in a bad mood, lowering the quality of our days. Another issue is that not being aware of our own thoughts leads to us living a significant part of our days inside of our own heads. This distracts us from being in the present and enjoying the moment. The practice of mindfulness does not aim to stop our thoughts altogether ‚Äî it aims to teach us to observe them. This puts us in control of our emotions and our reactions. This means that if we get angry, we do not stay angry ‚Äî and if we get happy, we can stay that way. Meditation is far from an easy task. Apps such as Headspace & Calm strive to make the practice easier ‚Äî but it in doing so, the apps miss out on the key essence of meditation. There is one app which I find tackles meditation head on ‚Äî and that is Sam Harris‚Äô app, Waking Up. The lessons are more difficult but definitely more rewarding. (I should mention that I am in no way affiliated with Sam Harris or the Waking Up app). There is no ‚Äúbest‚Äù meditation app ‚Äî there‚Äôs only the best for you, and that comes with trial and error. Every app has a free trial before you jump in. And it‚Äôs important to choose an app you‚Äôre more likely to stick to. Because then, you‚Äôre more likely to meditate. The purest form of meditation would be sitting down and doing nothing. No distractions, no phone, no television, no music ‚Äî only you and your thoughts. This is uncomfortable for almost everyone ‚Äî myself included, which is why using an app is easier. But the goal for us would be to one day be able to sit by ourselves in a room, and do nothing ‚Äî absolutely nothing ‚Äî and be okay with it. -- -- A collection of my thoughts, ideas and deliberations.

https://medium.com/marcopolo-protocol/pos-consensus-paradigm-shift-apos-better-than-pos-e5f7f112165f?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,PoS Consensus Paradigm Shift? APoS better than PoS?,Published in MAP Protocol,MarcoPolo OpenSource,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in MarcoPolo OpenSource Follow MAP Protocol -- Listen Share In the whitepaper of MarcoPolo Protocol (MAP), an improved PoS consensus called Asset PoS a.k.a APoS was proposed. In today‚Äôs article, we will have a deep dive into this APoS consensus and explain why this could be a trend in the future PoS consensus blockchain system. First, let‚Äôs have a quick cap about PoS consensus. Differ to PoW, which consumes an extreme amount of power to resolve a difficult mathematical problem. PoS is based on Staking, yes, the keyword here is staking. To simulate the stake-based Validator (in PoS, we call them validator rather than miner) selection process, the Follow-the-Satoshi (FTS) algorithm has been adopted in many PoS based block-chain networks such as Cardano, Dash, etc. The probability Œ°i that node i is selected to be the Validator in a network of N participants is where Si is the stake of participant i. This means that the more stake a node holds, the higher chance it is selected to be the Validator. And the Validator gets the coin rewards of course. See the following picture for easy understanding. Then on top of the common PoS, EOS, ‚Äúinvented‚Äù a DPoS (Delegated PoS) consensus. In the EOS ecosystem, globally there are 21 Validators or Super Nodes (they call themselves). Every participant I mean you and me normal guys, who owns EOS tokens need to stake on those Candidates who are competing for 21 Super Nodes, this process called Election, much like choose a Member of Parliament in real social life. The most powerful or popular 21 Nodes become the Super Nodes and they take in turn to validate the blocks and of course they get huge EOS coins as reward. I think this is more like a mining pool in the PoW word, only those big players get big profits. Now let‚Äôs talk about a new improved PoS, APoS, Asset-based Proof of Stake. This is a new concept from the white paper of MarcoPolo Protocol. Before we dive into what‚Äôs APoS, I think we need to understand what‚Äôs the purpose of the MarcoPolo Protocol and what issues the MarcoPolo Protocol tries to resolve. MarcoPolo Protocol aims to build a new peer to peer e-cash system, much like Bitcoin, but in a multiple coin interchangeable fashion. So basically you can think of multiple cryptocurrency trade settlement in the MarcoPolo Standard Chain. A good analogy is if we do business trade between Canda and Australia, then the settlement currency should be local currency, however, in the middle, the USD will be the exchange currency and using the SWIFT system to do the conversion. Of course, the MarcoPolo Protocol support Smart Contract and each Dapp will be in their own block-chain system. We will dig into this in future articles. So naturally it makes sense if I can use BTC to stake, or if I have ETH, then I should use ETH to stake, or in the future in MarcoPolo Protocol ecosystem, they can create their own tokens. I want to be able to use those tokens to stake. That is where the Asset comes into the picture, so in a nutshell, you can use any supported coins to stake in the MarcoPolo Protocol blockchain system. The APoS consensus is happening in following steps: For easy understanding, please refer the following diagram: In the diagram, every actor or normal Joe, can stake on their preferred Candidates by using MAP, BTC or ETH (Multi Assets), then the candidates get elected to Validator, The red-ish (stands for dishonesty node) Validator 100+ will be de-elected in the next cycle and the stakes on it will be decreased. So what are the advantages and questions with APoS? Some advantages are: Some questions are: In summary, it‚Äôs definitely a nice way to use your cold storage BTC or ETH to stake some of the latest blockchain projects and get some rewards, but how to make it fair, secure, transparent, easy-to-use still remain a question.

Many think it is all about ‚ÄòWeb Designing‚Äô, hence designing colourful web pages using images and fonts. This article is intended to explain these processes and their significance in application interface design. UI design focuses on visual design or skinning the wire-frames, where the creative designer plays with colours, shapes, layouts, typography and more. It is related to branding, colours, typography, iconography. The design team refers all these branding related aspects from a brand guidelines document. A digital first brand OR a brand looking at aggressive digital transformation should focus on a separate dedicated online brand guidelines document. User Interface Design is all about what the customer sees & feels while interacting with the design. From Left brain Right brain theory, UI is more Right brain, a work related to emotions, creativity, intuitiveness, imagination and free flow. User Experience Design starts with research followed by analysis and strategy. It is all about finding solutions, documentation, dealing with Information Architecture, Data, Wireframes, Prototyping, Decision making & similar logical attributes. It defines the structure of the product, funnels, scenarios, data flow & development plan for development team to use while defining the development sprints. User Experience is all about how the customer thinks & acts to complete the goal or tasks while using the application. From Left brain Right brain theory perspective, UX is more Left brain, a work related to Logic, Reason, structure, linear and functionality Customer Experience in digital context is everything the user uses and experiences during interacting with brand‚Äôs digital assets. It may start with a digital communication in form of a CTA (Call to action) on a mailer or digital advertise or a post on social media. It could be a task initiated on a self serving portal or a interactive funnel designed to take some action like purchase or booking. It could be as simple as raising a service request or submitting a complaint or locating a toll free contact number! How pleasing and easy the interaction with the digital asset happens defines the quality of customer experience. Effectively UI + UX + Data + Advertising + Branding + Sales process + Business strategy + Pricing + After sales service + Support and other things result in effective CX (Customer Experience). A good Customer Experience is a result of balance of Creativity (Right Brain) and Logic (Left brain) applied during application design. The balanced approach results in appealing and effective customer experience which results in acquisition, retention and revenue generation. In a SMART application definition, A stands for Attractive & Accessible which is nothing but building a balanced user interface and experience.

The basic premise here is leaping before looking, knowing that you have plans in place for errant actions. But what if you want to look before you leap? Specifically when working with files? All of our solutions will use the os library and use the isfile() method, which returns True or False. The remainder is dictated by where the file to be checked exists relative to the executing file. Asking yourself the following questions will ensure a thorough search. To check for a file that exists within the same directory as the executing file, simply pass the file name to the method as a string. If the file you are checking for is in a subdirectory of the executing file, then pass the relative path to the method. If the file is in a completely different directory or you don‚Äôt want to be restricted to a relative path, pass the absolute path to the method. -- -- 2 Advice for programmers.

https://medium.com/mytake/artificial-intelligence-is-revolutionizing-healthcare-and-this-is-why-e9b340542d28?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Healthcare- and this is why,Published in MyTake,Grace Byers,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Grace Byers Follow MyTake -- Listen Share Artificial intelligence is making waves in the medical industry, especially in the media. From bionic arms and robots performing detailed surgeries, it is hard to ignore. According to research conducted by HIMSS Media, 63% of research participants believe that ‚Äú AI and machine learning are already delivering value in specialty care including radiology, pathology and pharma.‚Äù This information is promising as it shows that the majority of people feel as if artificial intelligence and machine learning are making a positive impact in healthcare. This article focuses on why artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare, real-life use cases of the technology being used and the ethics surrounding implementing this kind of technology into the medical industry. The ways in which artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare goes beyond what you see in the media. We have seen Tilly Lockey, the first teenager in the UK with bionic arms. Open Bionics created these arms, the world‚Äôs first medically approved 3D printed bionic arms. However, there is much more technology being developed than this. These new types of technologies not only can be used to change patients lives, but also change the work lives of doctors and nurses by creating more efficiency and organization. AI can be used to create personalized treatment plans as well as better organized patient routes. This new technology can also be used to speed up processes such as discovering candidates for clinical drug trials. As well as this, artificial intelligence is being used in predicting diagnoses that require early intervention. This will improve the lives of patients and their families if they can use technology to detect illnesses prior to onset. There are many new companies driving the development of artificial intelligence in healthcare. I am going to discuss three companies at the forefront of this phenomenon, these are Nuance, AIVaid, and Prognos. Nuance is a multinational computer software technology corporation based in the United States. It is a company that uses artificial intelligence in many areas, such as communication and healthcare. Nuance uses their artificially intelligent technology in many sections, such as; documentation capture solutions, clinical and revenue integrity solutions, quality management solutions, optimization and consulting services, diagnostic solutions, and ambulatory solutions. Through using artificial intelligence to tackle all of these areas, it allows for transformations in both the lives of patients and staff. Their AI-powered solutions allow for 45% less time spent on documentation, this time saved can be used to care for and treat patients. AIVaid is a free application that uses machine learning and an inference engine( applies logical rules to the knowledge base to gather new information) to allow users, both patients and doctors, to ask medical questions to reveal possible conditions. The information used to develop this application is collected by the company Infermedica. This company collects, analyzes and organizes data and feeds it into the technology. This in turn allows the technology to learn and progress further. The last piece of their technology is the API which enables the user interface. Now that we have covered the technology, let‚Äôs discuss the benefits of using a tool like AIVaid. The first advantage would of course be cost as it is free. It saves time as you don‚Äôt have to travel, wait or attend meetings. The app is, as expected, 24/7, meaning you don‚Äôt have to be restricted by times of business. As well as this you also get instant, accurate reports. Another element of this application that is beneficial is trust. As it is a private and secure app, people can trust the app with their private data. Prognos is an artificial intelligence software company that use artificial intelligence to successfully diagnose patients in order to accelerate the treatment process. Prognos‚Äô technology is as advanced as it is because it has access to more than 20 billion medical records. In fact, the Prognos Registry is the largest source of clinical diagnostics information covering 50 disease areas, and 200 million patients. The ethics of using technology in industries, especially in healthcare and medicine, is often at the forefront of the conversation. We can‚Äôt afford to take things lightly as it may be a literal matter of life or death. There are many questions being asked, for example; who is responsible for the actions of AI machines? Will use of AI lead to an absence of a doctor-patient relationship? What about hacking? The ethics of data is a prominent issue at the moment and there have been many companies that have abused the use of artificial intelligence in technology for their own gain. In terms of healthcare and medicine, genetic testing companies such as 23andMe are selling the data they collect and analyze to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. This means that your genetic information will no longer be private information. This year, 23andMe signed a 4-year, $300 million deal with pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline. What is the purpose of this deal you may ask? Well, to develop new drugs is currently at the centre of their focus. However, there are organizations who use patient data for good and are transparent about how they use it. Project Fizzyo is a company that is collecting data from Cystic Fibrosis patients. The data is transferred directly to the clinicians and researchers caring for them. They use electronically chipped ACT (airway clearance technique) devices and wearable activity trackers to do so. They use this data to try and develop new treatments as well as make the current treatments more fun through gaming. To conclude, artificial intelligence will be used in the future to make the lives of both physicians and patients easier. As Eric Topol, MD, director and founder of Scripps Research Translational Institute has said: ‚ÄúBy augmenting human performance, AI has the potential to markedly improve productivity, efficiency, workflow, accuracy and speed, both for [physicians] and for patients ‚Ä¶ What I‚Äôm most excited about is using the future to bring back the past: to restore the care in healthcare.‚Äù *All views and opinions are mine and not of Oracle.* -- -- Smart Insight Communities Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*B5U8fWQJYfoVKj_cE8Pneg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*ihSVnTg-uPW3Dtq0Kgkniw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ihSVnTg-uPW3Dtq0Kgkniw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ihSVnTg-uPW3Dtq0Kgkniw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*B5U8fWQJYfoVKj_cE8Pneg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*B5U8fWQJYfoVKj_cE8Pneg.jpeg"

Whether we are turning an office into creating state-of-the-art wiring designs that include data cabling, lighting, energy and alarm systems, the designs we produce are critical to the success of the entire project. Therefore, in this publication, we think we would share with you our overall design process, so you can see how much effort and dedication are devoted to each one. Click here: Domestic Commercial Electrician Aylesbury Before the electrical design process can begin, we must ensure that what was requested works within the construction plans of the architect, the builder or the owner. These plans detail the information that the local inspection authority needs to know to approve the plans, as well as specific electrical designs and documentation that ensures that these designs will adhere to the required building regulations. We will determine if the electrical designs are feasible, we will suggest how they can be improved and then we will send the plans to the owner to send them to the local authority. The scope of the design depends on what the office requires. For example, if you require a new electrical system, we will determine the best way to incorporate all new electrical wiring into this system. At this stage, we also ensure that new systems can cope with additional loads that will be expected from them. A design plan will include several parts: General electrical requirements, such as electrical outlets found throughout the office, are used for computers. Specialized electrical requirements, for equipment that may need separate electrical circuits, such as microwaves and vending machines. ¬∑ Lighting systems, including accessories and their controls. ¬∑ Electrical distribution systems, such as the switchboard. When each part of the design plan has been determined, we design each part according to industry standards to ensure safety and performance. These standards include BS 7671: 2018, which refers to electrical installations, including protection against electric shock, voltage disturbances and thermal effects. With steps 1‚Äì3 complete, we create the plan using plans or a CAD tool (computer-aided design), which allows us to visualize the electrical circuits of the office. Each device is referenced by several symbols to ensure that everyone involved understands the plan. Then we present our plan to the architect or builder, who, as mentioned above, will transmit it to the local authority. It requires a lot of work and experience, but it is always worth it.

While Artificial Intelligence industry is undergoing a rapid development today, it also remains a disorderly and complex field where value creation still poses a significant challenge for both executives and investors. In general, sustained progress in an emerging field can be made viable only by establishing a strong and diverse ecosystem of players that are motivated to continue to push forward and deliver value to their partners and customers even during the periods of cooldowns. To quote Ron Adner of Tuck School of Business, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre only as good as your ecosystem‚Äù (HBR, 2016). Over the years, a number of different instruments have been developed to frame the thinking and help identify the existing gaps and investment opportunities in a particular industry, ranging from Porter‚Äôs five forces to Gartner‚Äôs hype cycle for emerging industries. However, the ever-accelerating pace of the world today forces much faster business decision making, which in turn creates a need among business leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors for a set of tools capable of delivering actionable insights. To address this need, we‚Äôve developed a framework allowing to evaluate the level of ecosystem maturity of any emerging technology field and helping to identify key growth catalysts and blockers. Conceptually, any technology space can be visualized as a series of ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù: it begins with the areas that are farthest from the end customers, and then continues to the areas that can be regarded as downstream, until we get to products and services that are being directly purchased by the end consumers (end products, or implemented solutions): Across all stages, there are 3 broad categories of commercial players involved: foundational product companies, specialized product players, and ‚Äúimplementers‚Äù: The level of maturity of each ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù influences the overall level of maturity of the ecosystem, while its ability to progress towards maturity is defined by a combination of two indicators: the alignment of expectations across stages and the availability of external funding at each stage: Across all stages, there are 3 broad categories of commercial players involved: foundational product companies, specialized product players, and ‚Äúimplementers‚Äù: The level of maturity of each ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù influences the overall level of maturity of the ecosystem, while its ability to progress towards maturity is defined by a combination of two indicators: the alignment of expectations across stages and the availability of external funding at each stage: For business executives looking to leverage AI technologies in their current businesses or build AI-infused products, it is crucial today to focus on the areas that represent the most substantial blockers on the path of overall ecosystem maturity, even if those areas don‚Äôt always appear to be the most attractive ones. Moreover, as it is the investors who support the formation of the ecosystem with their money until it could allow for sustainable business models to emerge, it is in their interest to incentivize the management to prioritize the opportunities that might bring the ecosystem to maturity faster.

Voice and audio have grown so much over the last few years, both in terms of the volume of content being created and consumed, and the advances in voice technology by companies in an attempt to dominate this emerging market. Limor, fortunately, foresaw this rise in the popularity of audio and traditional podcasting and began the process of getting the Limor concept developed and off the ground as far back as 2014 when CEO Shane Monahan first came up with the seed of the idea. This has put Limor in the very strong position as the ‚Äúfirst mover‚Äù. As it stands at the beginning of 2019, Limor has a fully launched app, a loyal user base, exciting content creators, and is in talks with a massive network of individuals, organizations and brands to join the Limor conspiracy ahead of a hard marketing drive in 2019. This networks includes professional sportspeople, movie stars, various media organizations and everything in between. Limor makes creating content easier than it‚Äôs ever been before with regards to audio and podcasting. What Instagram has done for photography, Limor has now done for audio. With the app installed, you can instantly record short social audio or full length traditional podcasts using just your phone, and from there, you have the ability to publish this content straight onto the Limor platform creating a following (listeners) in the process. Once published, anyone on the Limor app will be able to listen, like and comment on your material and also recast it to their own followers, thereby growing your following very quickly. The ability for people to leave voice comments on your cast is ideal for sparking instant real conversations. This ability for voice interaction is great for users to get in depth feedback on their content via voice from their listeners. It was essential when developing Limor that we ensured it was as easy as possible for people to navigate through and understand quickly. That is why by taking the best aspects of already existing traditional social media platforms, we have been able to create a new genre of social media within a new app, but in a way that everyone will feel accustomed to as soon as they sign up. After downloading the app for free, you will create your profile in a similar way to Instagram or Twitter, and after that it‚Äôs up to you what you do on your profile. If you just want to consume content then you can go straight to our discovery section and start listening / following other users, or if you want to build your own following just hit record, and publish your material for others to find. The video at the beginning of this article will give you a good insight into how to do all this. After recording your social audio or a traditional podcast, should you require it, you can use the built in editing function of Limor. This feature saves people time and money as you no longer need to go out and buy either a desktop or laptop powerful enough to run editing software, or purchase the software itself which can be very expensive. Limor currently offers both it‚Äôs platform, and recording / editing functions completely free of charge. If you are looking to start building your online content via voice then Limor is certainly the app for you.

We have all these methods of communication but are we really communicating? As a writer I love email. I love word processing programs. I love connecting with brilliant fascinating people around the globe. I am also still in love with postal mail and letter writing. Everyday my tech experience improves because I have cleaned it up and allowed in some fantastic content from extraordinary creators. I‚Äôm excited to see art, and read content and share emails with loved ones and answer questions and more. But this is not the case for most people. Most people are drowning in crap. We used to help people open doors and cross the street, and all that is still wonderful but wouldn‚Äôt it also be helpful if we helped a loved one: ¬∑ Unsubscribe to Junk Mail ¬∑ Manage their Inbox ¬∑ Learn to avoid Robot Calls If they learn how to use their phone in an emergency, it may also save lives. The TOT; Trash of Things is so overwhelming that folks are taking to social media for communication, while anyone who watches the news knows it‚Äôs not private or secure and cannot summon help for a person in an emergency. We‚Äôve all seen people take emergency medical issues to social media; scary on multiple levels. Bad bad bad and dangerous. Further, what of the beauty of writing a letter and receiving it, without drowning in a zillion emails per day from any corporate retail marketing department. Managing the Inbox: We could explain the difference between Opt-In and Opt-Out Around 2013 some email programs starting filing away email which was creepy because it was as if the email providers were reading our emails for us. Why how else could they file them? (Don‚Äôt fret I‚Äôm tech saavy enough to understand how). I learned about this filing function from a call from a dear friend. I found out then that my closest friends were not receiving my emails because my MicheleTheTrainer domain was being automatically filed for them into a Marketing, Promotional or even worse Junk folder. How lame. I personally write my emails and curate the content. I am not a robot. Seth Godin has written on this specific issue for years, but here‚Äôs a explanatory post from 2018, which is five years after I first noticed: https://seths.blog/2018/01/an-open-note-to-google/ If someone clearly Opts-In, they should get your emails. If I Opt-In to my local university or the botanical garden, I want their emails. We‚Äôve all Opt‚Äôed into something that we‚Äôve backed out of too due to inbox overload. If we don‚Äôt help people understand how to Opt-out, they will become spam infested and not visit their inbox. As a writer, this is a lost channel of communication. For the inbox user, it‚Äôs a lost opportunity to enhance their life by receiving remarkable content. Most folks today, however, just let their inbox become so unmanageable that they do not use it anymore. Like an ocean full of trash it‚Äôs become unusable. Just like using the phone is still very important today. Calling is the next best thing to talking in person. Yes I know about video calls but if someone can‚Äôt avoid robot scam calls or clean their inbox, they might not understand video calls either. Help them. In today‚Äôs trying times, the phone is also bringing a new level of robot calls, and criminal scams. I‚Äôve heard some outrageous bullshit. It‚Äôs important that everyone knows how to avoid this. Language exists for a reason. We have all these wonderful tools to communicate but if they are not managed, we go back to images like a caveman and cave paintings. As an artist and SCUBA diver I understand the power of visual arts. Visuals are also great communication tools, but they are absolutely not the only way to get information. Help someone else a couple times a week understand how to use their phone and inbox. It‚Äôs like teaching someone how to load a dishwasher or use the washing machine. These are tools that can improve daily life, if used correctly. The internet is amazing and there is some top content out there, but most folks are just wading in spammy bullshit. Save some lives.

It was very basic, but packed a lot of charm into its compact body. Later, the creator released the Tetris MicroCard, which was similar but only ran Tetris ‚Äî and, surprisingly, costs more than the Arduboy. Now, thanks to a licensing deal with Super Impulse, an entire range of Micro Arcade handhelds is going to be launched soon. Each Micro Arcade handheld game system is absolutely tiny ‚Äî about the size of a credit card. But, they‚Äôre capable of running complete games on an little full-color LCD screen. Each Micro Arcade console is built on the same tech as the Tetris MicroCard and has physical buttons for gameplay. However, they‚Äôre not programmable like the ArduBoy is. You just get the one game that‚Äôs burned into the hardware. That makes the Micro Arcade essentially a modern version of the classic Nintendo Game & Watch handhelds from the ‚Äô80s. Micro Arcade appears to be launching with six games: Space Invaders, Pac-man, Galaga, Frogger, Rally X, and an Atari model that presumably contains a few individual games. Each Micro Arcade will cost between $20 and $25, which is a little hard to swallow when you can play those games for free on your smartphone. But, if the idea of an adorable dedicated handheld appeals to you, these look really well made. -- -- 1 Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"
https://medium.com/@gadzehavi/personal-data-migration-revolutionizing-customer-data-f97857ea456?source=tag_archive---------115-----------------------,Personal data migration: revolutionizing customer data,Written by Gad Zehavi,Gad Zehavi,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Gad Zehavi Follow -- Listen Share They say the first cut is the deepest. While that might very well be true, according to millions of online grocery shoppers around the world, it is certain that the first shop is the hardest. Learning your way around the site, finding which section the product you are looking for is hidden in, trying to identify the correct size bottle, or read the ingredients of a new product ‚Äî all these things take time. This is what chases away many potential shoppers. But regular online grocery users know that once you have invested the time on that first shop, the next shop goes much faster. Most websites save your grocery list, so all you have to do is choose from the list all the things you bought last time, spend a few minutes adding other products, and check out. This is great when a person regularly shops online at the same retailer. Over time, all the products they buy weekly or monthly appear on their favorites list and the weekly grocery shop takes up to 15 minutes online instead of an hour in store. But what happens when a different online supermarket starts to deliver to your area? Their prices are better, their website is easy to navigate, but you just can‚Äôt face doing that first shop again. Consolid, a young startup based in Israel, has set out to change that. Consolid enables any user to move their favorites between retailer online sites. That means you, as a shopper, can go to the new online grocery store, click ‚ÄúImport Favorites‚Äù and get all your purchase history and your lists to the new site in a matter of seconds. No need to spend all that time and effort on doing a ‚Äúnew shop‚Äù. Import Favorites, introduced in the UK by mySupermarket, has already become market standard in the UK (the country with the highest share of online grocery shopping ‚Äî 7.2% share according to The Grocer) after it has been adopted by all major retailers, providing key value to both the retailer and the end user. The advantages to the customer is that it saves time (meaning they can check out faster), the selection is relevant and personalized, and they can try new supermarkets without the fear of having to commit to a new online grocery site that they may not like and without redoing the dreaded ‚Äúnew shop‚Äù. What is more, Consolid is a ground-breaking platform in that it provides customers with means to control their personal data, something that has been singled out as a key goal in the progress of the World Wide Web by no other than its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee in his new Solid initiative. The advantages for the retailers can be broken down to 3 key areas: >> Higher conversion through faster route to checkout and personalized experience Except for the obvious advantage of providing customers with a fast route to checkout, Consolid allows for a personal experience, even when trying a new store. eCommerce sites display recommendations, special offers and codes based on data about each customer‚Äôs previous purchases. Using Consolid enables the software to send notifications about products that are relevant to the customer ‚Äî a person who has diapers and formula on their list will receive a pop up about baby shampoo, a person who buys dry dog food each week will receive a code for ‚Äúbuy 3 get 1 free‚Äù on cans of dog food. This means that retailers can target new customers effectively from the very first time they shop at your site. The amount of data available about each customer through Consolid allows the retailer to build an enriched profile that gives them information about the preferred time of day that this customer shops, brands they like, if they respond well to offers, eating preferences such as organic, and many other variables. All this data allows the store to build a personalized shopping experience from the very first shop. And of course, if a customer has a good first experience, they are likely to return. >> Insights into competitor data, allowing for better market positioning Consolid gives grocery companies a unique insight into their competition. By allowing customers to import their personal data from a competing retailer, grocers can gain valuable insights into shopper habits and shopping patterns of users in competing retailers, allowing them to better analyze the competitive landscape and form better strategies leading to smarter business decisions. >> The ability to promote private label products As part of the matching process between different retailer‚Äôs products, Consolid provides retailers with the unique opportunity to promote their private label products when a branded replacement is not available or less suitable. Consolid enables users to fill the mental gap between brick-and-mortar and online stores and to hold accounts at multiple stores. Research shows that most people tend to shop in different brick-and-mortar supermarkets depending on what they are buying ‚Äî maybe there is a more expensive place closer to home where they shop in an emergency, and a cheaper place where they go for bulk products. Online shopping is no different. If one site has fast delivery service, but another has cheaper products, there is no reason for a customer not to shop in both places ‚Äî except that it is a pain in the neck! But with the ability to import lists between retailers, customers have the flexibility to choose where to shop and are more likely to do more of their grocery shopping online. Consolid can work with all categories of online retail, however we have chosen to begin with grocery since these shops take the longest and shoppers tend to buy the same items regularly ‚Äî meaning that Consolid can have an instant impact on customer satisfaction which will show in an increase of completed baskets.

Mohammad has been a lifelong technology enthusiast, starting out in the technology management industry as far back as 1996. His passion for progress, innovation, and creating technology marvels has made him one of the top most hospitality technology consultants in the US. As a young network & systems engineer Mohammed grew in ranks from site engineer, project manager, to maestro hotel technology consultant. He is a certified HFTP (Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals) consultant. Mohammed is also a career coach and source of inspiration for his executive team. He claims himself that his pursuit of perfection keeps him going to do better with each asset. Technology at hotels according to him should make time for more precious & cozy moments, it should leave a memory that you remember where ever you go. Mohammad loves to read and study about new technologies. He is also a frequent traveler with quite a travel manifest tracing from North America across Asia and Europe. Mohammad also enjoys discovering new cuisines, although he longs for his favorites from home every day. Advanced Hospitality: How important do you think technology is for hotels? Mohammad: Like any other industry technology plays a major role in making hospitality business easier. It‚Äôs not even limited to a handful of tech solutions. There are diverse applications of tech including project management, cybersecurity solutions, mobility tools, ERP & CMS software, and various others. Technology makes hospitality functions simpler, secure, and faster, making service delivery better than being delivered by humans alone. Advanced Hospitality: What are some of the advantages you have observed integrating technology in hotels? Mohammad: Over 25 years of implementing tech solutions and upgrading technology infrastructure, I have noticed countless benefits ranging from financial feasibility, operational efficiency, enhanced service quality, to more sustainable business operations across different properties. The emerging trend of big data & IoT has also intensified the applications of information technology for intelligent business decision making & strategy. Cutting edge cyber security solutions have also helped better data management and data storage at hotels. We are also working relentlessly to radically improve POS payment system security. Increasing hacks and data breaches across hospitality demand more rigorous monitoring and defense tools. We are therefore innovating the payment security process with the latest practices, tools, and better management principles.

Although on a metric level, biology is numbers and codes for how each atom in our bodies cluster together, we are more than just our genetic code. Our bodies belong to more than just us. Never have we ever been able to alter our biological makeup into other forms of variations. The rapid advancements in our technologies convince individuals that there will soon be various forms of genetic alterations. This brings forth the question in many people‚Äôs minds, will these types of inventions harm or benefit our human race? Many forms of research have and are being done to alter such changes to our genetic makeup. Gregory Stock, a writer and author of ‚ÄúRedesigning Humans choosing our genes, changing our future‚Äù claims that already ‚Äúresearchers have done early procedures on nonhuman primates‚Äù. Conducting experimental genetic research on other forms of life leaves us to question, when will they start to conduct experimental researches on human life? But the modification to our biological makeup is far more closely than many realize. We have started to come to a point in society where such advancements in technologies can potentially harm us rather than being beneficial. However, such genetic alterations are been in use for reversing potential health concerns within babies in the embryonic stage. Such new forms of technologies advancement are coming to play every year. On the other hand, surgical processes including ethnic plastic surgery or ethnic modification have been at work within our generation. The genetic alteration in order to improve one‚Äôs appearance has played a vast interest in today‚Äôs society. Gregory Stock responds to the outbreak of surgical changes to our appearance by proclaiming that technological advancements one day is able to reshape our genetic coding into more physical appealing ways, many individuals will take part. The status of money and competition amongst one another has been an ongoing setback in our society. The idea of altering one‚Äôs appearance to look more pleasing has changed the future of technological advancements, and what it could have potentially been. The possibility of uncertainty is high within new forms of technology. The idea of genetic enhancement on children has forever been in the minds of many physicians. However, Leon Kass, an American physician, scientist, educator, and a bioethicist at the University of Chicago, has no little to no doubt in the failing of such forms of advancements. Kass rather worries about treating every human life at any stage. ‚ÄúThere is something deeply repugnant and fundamentally transgressive about such a utilitarian treatment of prospective human life,‚Äù he writes. It is difficult to conclude that such a form of genetic alteration can bring upon beneficial and intended results. Yet the extinction and disasters to our human race will not be because of our failures but because of our successes. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*N7ML8iBwDJFsW5Oh.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*N7ML8iBwDJFsW5Oh.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*N7ML8iBwDJFsW5Oh.jpg"

Compatible Board,Alasdair Allan,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alasdair Allan Follow -- 1 Listen Share The final demise of Next Thing Co. left a good number of C.H.I.P. owners really rather annoyed. Predictably perhaps, that meant some of them tried to build a replacement. In the year since the company went under we‚Äôve seen at least one straight copy built around the same GR8 as the original C.H.I.P. Pro. briefly for sale on Amazon. However now it looks like the company that produced it, called Source Parts, is back with something that isn‚Äôt quite a clone. Called the Kettlepop, the new board is built around the GR8, but there have been some significant changes. The Kettlepop is based on the 1GHz-clocked Cortex-A8 GR8 System-in-Package, with 256MB RAM, and between 8GB and 128GB eMMC, and offers onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support. While the board is both pin and software compatible with the original C.H.I.P. Pro board, it‚Äôs not going to be around for long as the manufacturer has the last remaining stock of the GR8 available, as they say, ‚Äú‚Ä¶last year, after Next Thing Co. was liquidated, I was able to obtain 662 GR8 System-in-Packages which happened to be the last stock available on Earth.‚Äù Initially anticipating making a direct copy of the C.H.I.P Pro, changes were made to the open sourced design of the board due to the compromises inherent in the original design, there to save pennies, and keep the cost of the original board down as far as possible. ‚ÄúThe memory chosen for C.H.I.P Pro was 512MB Toshiba NAND Flash Memory because it was about a dollar cheaper than it‚Äôs more reliable counterpart eMMC Memory when you buy direct from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, without an initial order of thousands of pieces one has to resort to the open market to source this component. I found that the cost of this component on the market was higher than 8GB eMMC direct from the manufacturer Longsys‚Ä¶‚Äù The Kettlepop joins the other C.H.I.P derived board produced by Source Parts, the Popcorn Computer, based around the Allwinner R8, which is pin-to-pin compatible to the original C.H.I.P. rather than the C.H.I.P. Pro. Although still I‚Äôm not entirely sure why this new board exists, other than because they could build it, because it really doesn‚Äôt have a future. Source Parts is currently offering ‚Äú‚Ä¶500 units of Kettlepop for $19,500 USD at a price of $39 each.‚Äù But once they‚Äôre gone, they‚Äôre gone. There really isn‚Äôt a future for this GR8 design, so if you‚Äôre looking to replace your C.H.I.P you might want to look at a Beagle-ish copy that, while it shares the C.H.I.P form factor, has been built around the Octavo Systems OSD3358 better known as the ‚ÄúBeagleBone on a chip.‚Äù -- -- 1 Scientist, Author, Hacker, Maker, and Journalist.

Although the almost ten years that I lived there passed by so quickly, I learnt many valuable lessons. Most of them I learnt while I was waitressing tables on-and-off in the midst of receiving my tertiary education. One of my first memories was working at a well-known caf√© in the Lower East Side and I asked a famous actress what her daughter‚Äôs name is, only to be met with a nasty look and assumption that I should‚Äôve known her name. I laughed it off but this taught me a lesson that people of a certain stature usually expect to be treated a certain way. Here are four other things that I learnt while I was a waitress living in The Big Apple: I have made most of my adulthood friends from different restaurants that I have worked at, as well as romantic partners. To this day, one of my dearest friends is in his seventies and someone that I met at a restaurant that I worked at in S.O.H.O. I am so grateful for the experience of working at restaurants because it taught me that we are more alike than not. And, when we box ourselves into categories like race, income brackets and religious views, we only stop ourselves from accepting the highest form of love: love from anyone. 2. Respect is not about a bank account. I used to work at a famous restaurant in TriBeCa, we would have a well-known person in almost everyday. To be honest, sometimes I dreaded going in to work because we were treated by some of our authority and clientele like garbage on the floor. Sometimes it would upset me and hurt my feelings but I am grateful because I learnt one of the best lessons ever, respecting others is not determined by how much money the other person has in their bank account. Until someone proves otherwise, they deserve my respect. It took me going through that experience to remember and truly understand that. 3. Happiness is not dependent on ‚Äòwho you are‚Äô or how much money you have. I saw firsthand some of the wealthiest people in America with the saddest faces that I have ever seen. We have been sold this idea that money can buy everything. Yes, money is a tool that can connect you to a higher purpose and accessibility but if the reason why you have it is to bring you something that you can get without money, you have lost the plot. Money is like energy, it can be negative or positive in your life but it depends on your mindset and your intention behind having it. 4. Not everyone has to like me. When I was younger, I had this idea that everyone had to like me because if they didn‚Äôt, I had probably done something to them or wasn‚Äôt enough.This theory used to exhaust me and I allowed people to treat me with disrespect just so that they would stay in my life- making me feel better about myself. When a Manger or Customer treated me unkindly, I would take it personally and hold on to it for days and months. I thought that if I could control how they saw me, it would empower me; only to learn that it does the opposite. Ultimately, people treat me the way that they want to. All that I can do is be the best person that I am able to, show up, be kind and give my all. How people choose to treat me is their choice. My power lies in understanding that I can only control myself and freeing myself from other people‚Äôs expectations of me. -- -- A clean mind, a clean body and a clean planet.

Reasons for why the Japanese are having fewer babies and shrinking as a population aside, there are obvious issues that arise when a country has fewer people to participate in taxes, labor, savings, and a host of other functions necessary to maintain a nation. The silver lining is that these issues aren‚Äôt unique to Japan ‚Äî any developed nation can view what Japan‚Äôs experiencing as a warning and work towards creating their own solutions. In this article, we‚Äôll be taking a very brief look at how this large-scale population shift is, and will be, affecting Japan in the next 30 years. Births in Japan broke the one-million-per-year mark at 980,000 in 2016. This is a far cry from the 1949 baby boom (dankai no sedai) peak of 2.49 million, and Dankai Juinor generation peak in 1973 of 2.09 million. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research expects the Japanese population to hit 100m in 2053, and 88m in 2065. In other words, Japan will shrink in population count by a third in fifty years. And while the portion of the elderly in Japan at 27% looks surprisingly high compared to other Asian nations, the fertility rate, 1.44 in Japan, is on par with Korea (1.24), China (1.62), Thailand (1.50), albeit significantly below the level needed to maintain a population (2.1). There‚Äôs research indicating that every growing nation will at some point experience a boom in its economy due to population growth piping able adults into the workforce; Japan saw this between 1945 and the 70s, and so have South Korea and China. Indonesia, the Philippines, and India are waiting for their turn to take full advantage of this growth. But if you view Earth as one nation, the benefits of sudden population growth have already peaked. Sure there are countries in Africa and SE Asia that are still growing, but it is in no way similar to the level of population growth we saw around WW1 and WW2. As of 2015, 11.8% of the workforce is senior citizens, a >2x increase compared to 1980, and about 40% of seniors would like to keep working for as long as they can. Half of 65~69 year old men are still working, with 1.8% of them unemployed. But about 70% of senior employment is in the form of temporary or non-full-time work, rather than continuing on at their former place of work and prolonging their established career path for another decade. In addition, senior citizens are scoring higher on health tests. The number of dementia cases, however, is expected to grow from 1 in 7 to 1 in 5 by 2025. Average length of healthy life is increasing, but not as fast as the average life expectancy. Cancer, stroke, and lung issues top causes of death. Need for care providers is increasing, especially for those over 75. 26.2% of those requiring caretakers have spouses (especially women) acting as caretakers. Simply put, total factor productivity (TFP)is the amount of productivity that‚Äôs not captured or explained away by other obvious inputs to productivity like capital and labor. For example, TFP can show itself through the efficacy at which we use technology (e.g. fax versus SMS for communication, or cattle v tractors for tilling). It turns out that TFP decreases by 0.11 for every 1% increase in proportion of the elderly in a given population. Some explanation for this is that a) the lowered quality of labor as the average age of the working force increases, and b) the decrease in savings leading to decreased overall investments and capital flows. An older workforce may also contribute to less labor fluidity, and a lack of preparedness for high tech innovation. Simon Kuznets, a notable economist, stated that, assuming a steady level of experts in a given population, an increase in that population will necessarily increase the absolute number of experts in a population. In other words, this means the absolute number of experts in the Japanese population is in a steady decline. A decrease in population affects not only the quantity of labor, but also the quality of labor. We mentioned that 26.2% of those requiring caretakers have spouses (especially women) acting as caretakers. Their children come in at 21.8%, and their children‚Äôs spouse at 11.2%. 42% of caregivers provide care on an as-needed basis, whereas 25.2% take care of senior citizens around the clock. Of people who quit their jobs to take care of a senior citizen, around 80% were women. In addition, there is an increasing number of seniors‚Äô homes and those who work in geriatric care; but 3.3x increase in care workers in 2015 compared to 2000 still leaves us with a shortage in this field. On the other hand, about 40% of men and 30% of women under geriatric care would like to receive care at home, and more than 50% of senior citizens would like to end their lives at home. According to the World Bank, Japan spent 10.9% of GDP towards healthcare as of 2015, a 50% increase from 2000. Assuming both a decline in population along with an increase in the elderly as a portion of the population, not only will Japan have to scramble to find a solution to the obvious issue of increasing healthcare spending itself, but also how to distribute the burden created by the elderly majority across the dwindling workforce. Another, perhaps more personal issue, is that of who takes care of the elderly. The fact is that women (wives and daughters of the elderly) often end up quitting their jobs to focus on in-home care ‚Äî my leap-of-faith guess / gut feel tells me this is not so different in China or South Korea. This is in direct contrast to Womenomics, a series of proposals made by Prime Minister Abe‚Äôs government to promote women in the workforce; and putting on responsibilities to care for the elderly in addition to straining their financial position is no way to create a healthy end-of-life environment. CEO of MUJIN, an industrial robotics company, once stated that while the Japanese are concerned that robots will take away jobs, there aren‚Äôt nearly enough people from which robots can take jobs. The Japanese education system focuses on teamwork, memorization, and following rules ‚Äî a great combination if the goal is to pump out factory workers en masse. It doesn‚Äôt teach skills in career planning or how to think and adapt to new environments, creating a negative loop between the seniority-based, and inflexible labor market on one hand, and schools that teach the future workforce to stay in their lane. With the decreasing population to be put to work, along with advancements in robotics and automation, Japan‚Äôs education system will have to shift to one that emphasizes creativity, autonomy, and skills to constantly adapt to new environments as the pace of innovation continue to accelerate. With the population dwindling, the most obvious thing Japan can work on is opening up its borders to welcome immigrants like it‚Äôs never done before. Japan will have to accept both manual laborers as well as skilled workers, academics, etc. in order not only to supplement but improve future productivity levels and Japan‚Äôs position in the global economy. To add more color to the magnitude of aging in Japan, the ratio of the working population in Japan to the elderly sits at 2.0 as of 2018 ‚Äî this means that for every one person over the age of 65, there are 2 people in the workforce supporting the elderly through their productivity, taxes, etc. This used to be 12.1 in 1950, and is expected to hit 1.3 by 2065. This is a task I want to see Japan undertake most from a perspective of a large-scale cultural shift, since the Japanese aren‚Äôt known to the world as the most accepting of others. From the number of non-Japanese in Japan, to the number of asylum seekers it accepts every year, Japan lags in understanding, much less welcoming, foreigners into their own home.

No One Knows,Published in PC Magazine,PCMag,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- 3 Listen Share Apple patched its FaceTime bug, but we can‚Äôt truly trust the company until it opens up its source code. By Ben Dickson Apple recently fixed one of the worst security bugs ever discovered in iOS, which allowed a FaceTime caller to hear what people were saying before they answered the call. So what went wrong, and can we prevent another similar disaster? We just don‚Äôt know. Apple doesn‚Äôt make the source code for its operating systems and apps publicly available. Only the company‚Äôs own engineers, developers, and quality assurance staff test and fix errors in its applications. And Apple requires its employees to sign stringent non-disclosure agreements about its products. This walled-garden approach means we must trust Apple to deliver secure products. That said, Apple has one of the most robust software development processes around. Its reputation is backed by more than four decades of delivering secure and reliable applications and products. But once in a while, the failures of security through obscurity ‚Äî depending on secrecy to ensure security ‚Äî hit home. The FaceTime bug was an example. Compared to complicated security bugs that require resources and expertise to discover and exploit, the FaceTime bug was trivial. In fact, it was discovered by a 14-year-old who was playing Fortnite with his friends. But it raises a question: How could a company with the integrity of Apple miss such an obvious flaw in one of its most-used applications? Was it intentionally caused by a disgruntled employee who wanted revenge? Was it a government-implanted backdoor? Was it an honest, one-in-a-million mistake that could have slipped through the defenses of even the most trustworthy company? It‚Äôs hard to answer that question independently. We have to rely on whatever information Apple gives us. And so far, Apple hasn‚Äôt said much except that it has fixed the flaw in iOS 12.1.4 and will be rewarding the Arizona teenager who first reported the glitch. We‚Äôll also probably never know when the exploit began. According to reports, the bug applied to all devices running iOS 12.1 or later. Released on October 30, 2018, iOS 12.1 added Group FaceTime, the feature that contained the eavesdropping bug. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine that a bug out in the open running on hundreds of millions of devices would remain undiscovered for several months. Maybe the bug was introduced more recently, as the Apple development team made updates to FaceTime‚Äôs server-side software. Again, we won‚Äôt know unless Apple tells us. In contrast, many organizations have an open-source policy, releasing the full source code of their applications on platforms such as GitHub and making it available for anyone to review. Independent experts and developers can then verify the application‚Äôs security. The practice has become increasingly popular in the past few years and has even attracted some historically tight-lipped participants. A great example of transparency is the secure messaging app Signal. Open Whisper Systems, the company that develops Signal, has published the source code of all versions of its application on GitHub. The entire history of the app‚Äôs source code, its contributors, and the changes made to the app are visible to everyone. Signal‚Äôs source code has been reviewed by hundreds of experts and has earned the approval of industry leaders such as Bruce Schneier, Edward Snowden, and Matt Green. Does this mean that open-source applications have no security flaws? Far from it. Applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code are complex creations and hard to secure, no matter how many eyes review the code. In fact, Signal has churned out a few nasty bugs of its own, including one that would let hackers steal your chats in plain text. But in contrast to closed-source apps such as FaceTime, anyone can easily track the source and reasons for flaws in apps such as Signal, as well as when they originated and which code change or new feature caused them. But in the case of the FaceTime bug, we‚Äôll have to speculate. Transparency establishes trust. Obscurity destroys it.

The old-world teaching has resulted in many students becoming ill-prepared for an ever changing and fast-paced global world. In many cases, many schools and higher level of education are using methods and tools that do not allow students to become engaged and energetic about learning. Depending on the field of study such as accounting, the learning is a slow-moving train wreck. So, how can school better educate people in the 21st century?

She mentioned that these two generations learn through technology and hands-on experience. The article was tailored towards implementing new methods in educating the mentioned groups in fraud examination.

Our team decided to tackle this and present users with an all-new design of Neo4j‚Äôs developer guide pages. The team has worked hard to bring a polished look to content on concepts, explanations, and walkthroughs for topics surrounding Neo4j products, tools and libraries, and development with Neo4j. Web development is never as simple as hoped. We learned a lot in the process and were able to tackle some very specific goals to minimize support, increase maintainability, and (hopefully!) improve user experience. Our 2 main goals for the project were the following: To accomplish these goals, there were a few components where we made changes. In the end, we were able to go live with an improved version that serves as the foundation for additional changes in the near future. Let‚Äôs take a look at what we did and how we got there! As a tech company, we needed to structure components for a variety of learning approaches. Some users walk through page-by-page and studiously follow an outline, while others search for adhoc topics or answers. We needed to provide for these two extremes, as well as for a mix of scenarios and users. This is where our multi-section layout is based. Along the top of the page, there is a header with our company/product logo, along with key resources for developers to learn about our technology. Beneath the header is the core of our material in 3 columns ‚Äî left navigation menu for topic sections, middle column for core content, and right menu for outline of core contents. To build this frame, we used the CSS flexbox, which helps design a flexible and responsive structure (W3Schools CSS Flexbox). Our HTML outline looks something like below. And the CSS properties, then, use the display: flex; property on the parent <div> with a few other properties set on the child elements. As you can see, the content-wrapper div sets the child components as flexible and also aligns the items at the start of the container. Each of the child items can then be customized and adjusted to the desired spot on the page. The dev-menu-nav element is the left navigation menu. This should take up the entire left side of the page until it reaches the footer, which extends across the bottom. We defined the flex property with a value of 1.5, which means the column can grow up to 1.5x times its size before it stops expanding. We also set the align-self property to stretch, so that the menu will extend to the bottom of the parent container and not stop at content height. The middle column is for our main content. It kept a pretty simple layout without much configuration. We only defined it to float to the left in our CSS, and this section extends the length of the contents in the guide. The final column is for the hovering right menu. This was a bit tricky to figure out, especially in tandem with the left menu. While the left menu extended the full parent height and menu contents remain static, the right menu should only be the size of its contents and scroll with the page. To accomplish this, we set the position to sticky, allowing the container to stick to the viewport and move separately from the page contents (letting it hover when scrolling) and set the flex value at 1, so that the menu size didn‚Äôt fluctuate with window size. While it seems rather simple, it took us some time to do the research and understand how to make the components somewhat independent, as well as somewhat aligned with each other. Users read and learn in all kinds of formats, including from phones, tablets, and desktop monitors. To support and improve experience from different devices, we hid non-essential content from the page in a mobile view and maximized content on the page for wider or larger screens. The design needed to be flexible to adjust to screen size and content. Since our layout used the flex display property, the columns scale according to the content width and the flex values we set. We set the left menu to scale up to 1.5 (flex: 1.5) and the right menu to grow up to 1 (no scaling). Our middle section, however, scaled too much on a large screen. This made the text sparse and difficult to read, so we needed to tell this section when to stop extending. It should also adjust menu width to the content for menu items with short or long strings of text. Our team‚Äôs general rule is about 120 characters per line. We can use the max-width property to set a maximum size for certain components to grow, but there wasn‚Äôt a way to use characters for the value of that property. Using a converter, 120 characters in our line calculated to 960px, which we adjusted slightly for font and size. These values ensured that all three sections scaled, but only to a certain point. This allowed text, videos, diagrams, and images in the middle section to efficiently use screen real estate without stretching and making it unreadable. To handle the screen sizing for varying devices, we used standard column classes to show and hide certain elements. The small/medium/large-# tells the browser how many columns at each size scale that the div should take up out of the 12 in a web page. Our left menu div (dev-menu-nav) has large-2 to take 2 columns in a large size, then hide-for-medium-only and hide-for-small-only, so it will be hidden on medium and small screen formats. Note: medium screen size is smaller than anticipated. ;) The middle column (guide-section-content) has large-8 to use 8 columns at large scale. Since we don‚Äôt specify medium or small size classes, it will maintain that scale in all formats. The last div for our right menu (guide-toc) has the same classes that our left menu does ‚Äî 2 columns at large scale, then hidden at both smaller sizes. The classes and max-width CSS that we added here ensured both menus are hidden on a mobile phone or narrow window, but that all elements scaled well on a large screen, with most screen real estate and scaling flexibility given to the main content in the middle. We needed to enable the left menu to expand and collapse all sections at once to allow users to view all of the guides and topics. A simple Javascript function was able to handle this for us, with a function call added to the html element. HTML: Javascript: The expandMenu function is called in the <dd> tag of each menu list section and passes the current element (this) to the function. The function defined in our Javascript file toggles an active class on both the current element (<dd>), as well as the next element (panel-dev-nav). The function also shows and hides the inner panel with all the links in the section (panel-dev-nav) and lets the section expand to the scroll height for varying numbers of links in each section. CSS handles the active class styling for change in color, altering the + icon to a - when it‚Äôs open, and dropdown speed. Table of contents sections are helpful to see what a page covers or to find a specific topic. We created a hovering menu on the right side of the page with an unobtrusive, bookmark-like style. As a plus, it follows the window scrolling and highlights the current section in the view. Coding this involved setting up section headers with anchor tags. Most of our pages are written in Asciidoc with some Ruby templates and converters to render the Asciidoc to HTML. It‚Äôs simple enough to use an anchor in Asciidoc. You just need two items. 1. Some configurations at the top of the file for the renderer to include section link anchors, a table of contents (toc), the header of the toc, and the number nested levels anchored. 2. The [#tag] syntax above each header at the specified level. Note: what you put in the brackets will be the id value of that element in the HTML. In our Ruby template, we pull the tag from current page and set the id of the HTML element to that retrieved tag value, like below. Finally, all that is left to do is track the scroll in the webpage and highlight each section as it hits the viewport. This seems fancy, but it was easily handled with some Javascript and CSS. There are a few libraries that implement this functionality, as well, but many seemed to bundle unnecessary dependencies that bloated size and complexity. First, let‚Äôs look at the Javascript. The first section of the code finds which div is most visible in the viewport and adds an active class to that element. The next code paragraph sets up the observer and its options on sensitivity for how much each section needs to be in the viewport before changing whether it‚Äôs active or not. Then, the next block loops through sections in the page, and the final block is the jQuery(document).ready() that calls the observer function when the document changes (including on scroll). For the highlighting, we simply add a block to our CSS file that changes the text color and font weight of the elements when the active class is present. This is what the CSS looks like. When looking at technical content, we wanted to keep options succinct to reduce distractions and decisions on where to go or what to look at. To meet this, we created a developer header with only the key developer-related resources. We felt that these links represented resources that users would frequent, as well as places we wanted users to go for learning or knowledge-sharing. On this container, we borrowed most of the styles from the rest of our neo4j.com header, but we altered a couple of things. We wanted a mental and visual separation/shift between main site content and technical guide content. Using a change in color helped us cleanly differentiate between the two, as well as create stark contrast between menus and guide text (dark menu background vs light guide background). Just as with our page content, this menu needed to be adaptable for various sizes, as well. Though a lot of the styling was defined from the main site, we altered one small CSS property on the <ul> elements within the top-bar-right div. This ensured that the page would not wrap the menu on a narrow window. On small screens, the wrapping left an ugly white margin on the right and cut off the bottom of wrapped content. In the paragraphs above, we touched on the fact that we wanted separation between technical and other sections of the Neo4j website, with color shifts as a way to accomplish this. There were a few other factors at work in this decision, as well as some reasoning about color choices. One of the general things we noted is that dark mode themes for screens, editors, and other developer interfaces are very popular, so this styling mimics what many developers are already familiar with and may prefer. However, dark text on light backgrounds is still the standard way to read material (books, webpages, etc), so we blended the two. Since darker elements tend to draw less attention, this seemed like a good fit for the menus and side elements. This also allowed us to contrast the darker trim with a lighter guide in the middle and draw focus to the learning material. We were very specific in the colors that we chose. The grey colors are the same ones that appear in our products like Neo4j Desktop and Browser. This created a consistent visual sense, whether interacting with our products or learning how to use them. These colors have also already been tested for user experience and compatibility. The dark styling extended to our code blocks, as well. We used a dark background and text highlighting similar to IntelliJ IDEA‚Äôs darcula theme. This has the additional benefit of familiar code styling that pops against the main content text throughout many pages. We used CodeMirror library‚Äôs out-of-the-box darcula mode to apply this style to the code blocks. To implement this, we included the darcula.css file in our project, then used uglify to bundle the styles and programming language modes into a Javascript file. With these dependencies and the CSS classes on the appropriate HTML elements, we have code blocks that now look like this! In a previous section, we used anchor links for the right menu to track and highlight where the viewport was in the content. It‚Äôs also helpful for another thing, though ‚Äî leaving and returning to a specific section within a page. The anchor link marks the location of tagged sections and adds the tag to the URL so the browser window displays that particular section. This avoids having to send a page link to a colleague or friend and telling them which paragraph or section to look at for the desired information. Just click the anchor link icon next to the related headline, copy the browser url (which has the anchor tag at the end), and send it along. The receiving person can open the page in the subsection that the sharer wanted. Our quick (not necessarily permanent) solution was to do this in Javascript. We definitely plan to explore other ways for a simpler and more elegant solution. Let‚Äôs take a look at what we have. Over time, our team will adjust a few styles and make updates. We will work (as always) on better and cleaner solutions and hope to continue improving the user experience Neo4j‚Äôs developer content.

This article will help you learn what you can do to increase the amount of leads you receive. Mix Up Your Lead Types An easy start is to open up to all types of leads. Are you only purchasing Shared Leads? Then maybe you should consider Exclusive Leads and/or Live Transfers. There are a handful of benefits to opening your lead mix to Shared, Exclusive, and Live Transfer leads. Shared leads provide a lower price point and greater volume opportunity. With the industry standard shared rate being 5x, we wanted to take an extra step to improve quality and recently lowered our shared rate from 5 to 4. This has had a significant improvement in conversion rates. Otherwise, our Exclusive Leads are going to be more expensive than our Shared Leads, but you are the only one with your hands on the lead, making it easier to convert. You can also add an additional feature to these leads called Premium Listings, which you can learn about in this article. Live Transfers are also a better quality option, being that we qualify the calls before sending them to your line, making the conversion rate very high. Start by expanding your lead types and you will see volume increase. Expand Your Filtering Opening your filters can increase the amount of leads you will receive. By expanding day-parting, income, household size, age, and medical conditions, you will have access to more leads in which you can convert for lower prices. Everyone is purchasing leads during business hours, so have you thought about weeknights or weekends? This traffic is drastically cheaper, lowest on weeknights, followed closely by weekends, and we even have features to contact the lead right away. We have a text service that can send the lead a message right when you receive the lead, and our premium listing service where the lead can receive your contact information. Even though you are not in the office at the moment, you are able to contact the lead immediately with our technology. The chart above shows the hours from least competitive to most competitive. Green, which are weeknights are the least competitive so you can get the most for your dollar, yellow is a close second and red are the times when most people are bidding for leads. If you look outside of business hours, you are bound to score some more leads at a cheaper rate. Apart from that, you can expand on your leads income, household size, age, and medical conditions, which is bound to increase your volume. Segment Your Campaigns Properly segmenting your campaigns is proven to be the most important thing you can do to succeed with NextGen Leads. On average, smaller agents should have at least three campaigns, and in some cases larger customers will run well over a dozen. The best way to segment campaigns is by the lead information you absolutely need, all the way to the information for the perfect lead. A lead that meets all of your qualifications should have a higher bid than a lead that may only meet the bare minimum. If you do not know the best way to segment your campaigns, reach out to your Account Manager today. if you do not have an account manager, feel free to contact us at support@nextgenleads.com. By mixing up your lead types, expanding your filtering, and segmenting your campaigns you can be assured to pull in more traffic. -- -- NextGen Leads' Company Blog Media Buyer for NextGen Leads.

Along with mega financing rounds of late-stage startups in the value chain ($865 million in Katerra), cloud base solutions ($75 million in Procore), there is a significant increase in early stage startups. In addition, extensive M&A activity can be seen and the market leaders software companies acquired smaller companies. In the last year at least 13 major mergers and acquisitions were made, including Autodesk, which announced a few months ago about acquisition of two cloud-based start-ups: PlanGrid for $875 million and BuildingConnected for another $275 million, while, Trimble announced on July about the acquisition of Viewpoint for $1.2 billion. The global trend has not skipped Israel - the Startup Nation - and we are witnessing here in the land of milk and honey a significant increase in entrepreneurs entering this traditional market, local players and global players who adopt the innovative solutions and lead the change and the investors who recognize the opportunity. In this race for innovation not only the startups are participating - we can see global leaders whom are looking for technologies and solutions that can change the industry and provide them with a competitive advantage in this disruption race. While mapping the Israeli construction-tech ecosystem we identified an increase of more than 30% in the number of new startup companies that entered to this lion‚Äôs den of construction. And it seems that the new entrepreneurs that have joined us this year are more mature, raising bigger financing rounds from investors and developing solutions that some of them ‚Äî with tons of hard work, good guidance and lots of luck ‚Äî have the potential to change this traditional industry. The sector of activity in the field of construction and infrastructure is so broad and the fields of specialization are so fragmented that there is no singular point that will disrupt an entire industry. It‚Äôs difficult to imagine a company that can do what UBER did to taxis or the Airbnb to hotels. On the other hand, the ecosystem together like an aircraft fleet of technological solutions are tackling all together the industry and moving it forward. At Shikun&Binui - Israel‚Äôs leading construction and real estate company and Infralab - the construction tech and smart infrastructure innovation lab, we believe that in coming years (or even months) we will see many entrepreneurs invading into this area that affects all of our lives - housing, offices, roads, tunnels, energy, bridges and many many more. Existing startups will become businesses that are growing and based on global markets. At the same time, large and traditional companies will promote innovation in the industry and take steps that will change the facing the industry. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*ZDHRslDVpFnZEsRaprT0vA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ZDHRslDVpFnZEsRaprT0vA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ZDHRslDVpFnZEsRaprT0vA.jpeg"

https://medium.com/@OiCOiN/why-osmium-ab0c48676a3?source=tag_archive---------161-----------------------,Why Osmium?,Written by Osmium Investment Coin,Osmium Investment Coin,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Osmium Investment Coin Follow -- Listen Share Let‚Äôs begin with the old story of supply and demand. This common economic model is to be perfectly seen during the introduction of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù precious metals like Platinum, Rhodium, Iridium and Ruthenium. Our case will be a lot more dramatic through the scarcity of Osmium. Platinum, Rhodium, Iridium and Ruthenium can be still mined. Osmium will be off the raw material market. Once a product cannot be produced or mined any longer, the supply (in this case ‚Äúthe investors‚Äù) will be the technology trigger to skyrocket the price. OSMIUM SUPERSTAR Osmium has several unique characteristics that makes its market very special and very interesting. In the past Osmium was used as alloy for changing characteristics of other metals to make them harder and durable. The possession and storage of mined Osmium is not uncritical since Osmium is considered to be toxic in its native form the ‚ÄúOsmium sponge‚Äù ‚Äî a form of powder. This powder tends to form osmium tetroxide, which is responsible for the health hazard. For this reason, Osmium was not allowed to be traded by private parties. Since the 1990s our group of metallurgists have developed a method of overcoming this problem and succeeded in discovering and perfecting the process of crystallization. This process changes the crystal structure of osmium and massively limits its chemical reactivity. In its unreactive crystalline form, osmium behaves even more ‚Äúnobly‚Äù than the other precious metals. It also takes on a mythical and mysterious glow in the sunlight. For its uniqueness, crystalline osmium has been spotted for the wristwatch and jewellery markets. One of the first movers which is using osmium in this way is Swiss luxury watch producer ‚ÄúHublot‚Äù. www.hublot.com/en/news/classic-fusion-firmament It can be crystallized in two and or in three-dimensional forms. Osmium is therefore very well appreciated in the jewellery market. The investor market is now splitting up into two large segments. On the one hand, people invest in osmium, store it for five to ten years and then plan to sell it to the later growing jewellery market. On the other hand, speculators who wish to take advantage of the same type of growth patterns observed in the past with the other precious metals are intrigued by the expected ‚Äúhype‚Äù. However, it is foreseeable that the development of osmium will be different in some points, which are worth a closer look. Osmium is the only precious metal that will completely disappear from the market when about 40 tons are sold. Further reservoirs cannot be discovered, as osmium mining outside the associated deposits with other metals is economically not worthwhile. Only 30 grams of Osmium are found in 10,000 tons of platinum ore ‚Äî an equivalent of 250 truckloads! A second development is the split of the investor market into two sections. On the one hand, there is the spot business conducted between mines and processing companies that use osmium in special applications and operate in accordance with the REACH agreement. This international agreement restricts trade of specific chemicals. The regular non-crystallized osmium market is not open to private users and investors, as osmium is not and must not be traded outside the chemical industry due to the formation of the toxic osmium tetroxide. Since 2013 the private investment market has been solely focused on crystalline osmium, since the change of the crystal structure of osmium produces an extremely high degree of purity and, above all, causes it to lose its toxicity. Crystallization of Osmium is a very complex process which takes weeks under very high pressures and specific gas environment. A method that has been developed over decades. At the same time, it was discovered by the first private investors, who profited from osmium with high margins of up to 450 percent within just three years. We are so far ahead with all metallurgic know-how and hold all relevant mining contracts that nobody else will be in the situation to crystallize Osmium elsewhere. SIGNIFICANT REASONS FOR PRICE INCREASE It can be predicted, however, that the market entry of Osmium will be accompanied by much more significant price increases for several reasons. First, Osmium is much rarer than all the other precious metals. The annual processing for the investment market is only 120 kg. The production for various applications is up to 360 kg per year but is stretched as much as possible and depends on platinum and nickel production. In addition, contracts have been signed in recent decades for our crystallization company to option large quantities of Osmium, which currently allows access to much larger quantities of Osmium. Almost all Osmium that is not used in platinum alloys or in the chemical industry goes into crystallization. Since Osmium is entirely unforgeable, it can also be certified over long distances and authenticated by the crystal structure. Each piece is unique like a fingerprint. The shortage of crystalline Osmium is progressing rapidly, although sufficient quantities of Osmium can still be introduced into the investor and processing market at present. The global extractable amount of osmium is about 9 m¬≥. A maximum of 2 m¬≥ of this will be degradable in the next decade. At a density of 22.61 g/cm¬≥, this corresponds to a mass of about 44,000 kg. Crystallization in 3D shapes has also brought a new form factor into the scene. Osmium pearls are small, round 3D structures with a hole for crystallization purposes, which can be drilled through completely and then worn like pearls. They are currently the most valuable osmium objects, as only one of 10 pearls succeed in crystallization. Osmium pearls have the potential to rise 100 percent in value over a single year.

This means that your EON isn‚Äôt reading CAN data from the stock camera. Technically, this is an acceptable configuration: openpilot detects if the stock camera is disconnected and, if so, generates all the CAN messages to mock the stock camera. However, this has a drawback: camera-based stock features that openpilot does not have yet (such as AEB, auto-high-beam and speed limit reading) are disabled if you drive using openpilot without the stock camera active. This configuration will be unsupported by openpilot releases after 0.6.5. A much better technical solution, also already supported by openpilot, is to keep the stock camera turned on but isolated on its own CAN bus. openpilot, through the panda, forwards all the stock camera messages to the rest of the CAN bus, except for the ones needed by openpilot to perform lateral and longitudinal controls. Unfortunately, Toyota Giraffes sold prior to October 2018 lack the 120 Ohm resistor to properly terminate the camera CAN bus. If you are in this group, don‚Äôt despair: as you can see below, there are a few simple alternatives to fix this to avoid having to renounce the stock features while using openpilot. This is the easiest: if you bought your giraffe after May 2019 (higher than order 4467), you have the built-in resistor. Simply pull the giraffe switch 2 to high. Also make sure that the giraffe is plugged into the stock camera. Now, restart your car and check if the alert on your EON display disappears. If not, continue reading: your giraffe does not have a built-in resistor. You can install a 120 Ohm resistor between pins 12 and 13 of your Panda yourself. You can either buy the resistor or you should have received one with your Giraffe, if you bought it after October 2018. Pull the giraffe switch 2 to high, make sure the giraffe is plugged into the stock camera and restart your car. Buy a new Toyota Giraffe, which comes with a built-in 120 Ohm resistor. Buy a new comma car harness, which comes with many more benefits! -- -- 1 Make driving chill.

Weiss Follow The Startup -- 7 Share When I was a boy living in the mountains of Northern California, I used to venture into the woods behind our house. There was a favorite tree I often climbed. At the top, the limbs splayed about perfectly into a kind of chair. I would sit there, nestled in the canopy of leaves, as the wind gently rocked the tree back and forth. I used to close my eyes in silence and listen to the soft sounds of the woods. The quiet song of birds, the breeze rustling through my hair. I was alone with my thoughts, and a kind of peace would wash over me. Other days, I used to lie down on our living room carpet with my sketchpad and pencils. In the quiet of my imagination, I drew all kinds of things. Warriors, strange creatures and fantasy landscapes. I was completely relaxed and absorbed in my creativity. Fast forward forty years or so, and everything nowadays seems to be punctuated by noise. Quiet reflection and peaceful moments have been drowned out by blaring screens, screaming car stereos, chattering YouTube videos and people with their phones on speaker as they stand in the grocery store check out line.

Millennials or so-called Generation X are two economically active demographics with more interest in cryptocurrency than any other. They also like to play video games. In what follows, I discuss the various ways that game developers are integrating cryptocurrencies into their products. Many games now have a form of in-game currency that players can earn, buy and spend. These currencies are typically bought within the game with fiat cash or gift cards. Usually, these monetized games are offered free and game currencies and associated item purchases are promoted within the game to encourage players to spend money. ‚ÄúIf we look at top games, no matter in which category, they have one thing in common: they‚Äôve enabled their virtual economy (and that‚Äôs how they monetize as of today).‚Äù Ryan Wang, founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital company Outpost Capital However, the rise of gaming combined with the popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to a new trend where more and more game developers are ‚Äútokenizing‚Äù game assets. Virtual in-game currencies can be tokenized by basing them on a blockchain network and attributing value and existence to them in their own right (not only as in-game currency). This is because using blockchain technology in this way creates a cryptographic accounting system for game tokens, which also allows game assets to be bought, sold, and traded outside of the game. One startup called ClanPlay has plans to reward players of games like Clash Royale for their in-game actions with a new cryptocurrency called ‚ÄúGood Game.‚Äù The token is earned and used within games, but unlike familiar virtual currencies, Good Game will also be traded on exchanges and held in wallets as a cryptocurrency outside of the games. Another company called Chukong Technologies based in Beijing, China, is also making inroads in integrating gaming with blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Chukong owns the open-source mobile game development platform Cocos2d-x. Cocos2d-x has over 1 million developers building games on its platform and has delivered successful titles like Angry Birds and Clash of Kings. Chukong has now started a blockchain-based gaming company called Cocos-BCX that has raised $40 million in capital funding. ‚ÄúWith this new injection of capital, we will push the blockchain gaming industry forward and focus on penetrating the market faster than anyone else in this space.‚Äù Haozhi Chen (Chukong co-founder), Venturebeat, September 2018. Yet another example is the Galaxy Digital investment fund, which recently led a round of funding for another blockchain gaming startup based in Seattle called Mythical Games. Its founders have worked on popular games like Call of Duty and Guitar Hero but have now turned their skills to developing blockchain-based games. ‚ÄúWe believe that gaming ‚Äî and specifically players‚Äô interaction with in-game economies and virtual goods ‚Äî will play a key role in how the masses first discover the true potential of the blockchain,‚Äù said Mike Novogratz ‚Äî founder of Galaxy Digital. Soon, gamers could be earning virtual currencies that are actually tradeable crypto-assets, with an immediate real-world value. Monetization and the creation of new digital micro-economies within games in this way reward developers and game players alike. It is also a good business idea as it incentivizes people to play more. The chance to play video games and earn money at the same time is attractive. As more game players start using digital currency in this way, the use of cryptocurrency and blockchain will also increase. People that have never owned cryptocurrencies before may find themselves with a balance of coins thanks to playing their favourite game. They could then become interested in transferring this balance to a cryptocurrency wallet or an exchange to trade into Bitcoin or fiat currency.

Login to your favorite exchange, link your bank account or credit card, then buy or sell. It‚Äôs that simple. However, behind the curtain of your simplified and user friendly experience with your bitcoin exchange exists a complex world of financial regulation and banking practices that are rarely discussed in public. I‚Äôm writing today to shed light upon this dark and convoluted system that is stifling small, law abiding, bitcoin startups. In order for me to explain some of the situations that so many individuals and businesses have experienced, I need to define some terminology and the regulators that are involved. Its enough to put the average person to sleep, but if you‚Äôre in the bitcoin business industry, or want to be, this is some important stuff. In 1970 congress passed the Banking Secrecy Act (BSA), a law requiring financial institutions in the United States to assist government agencies to help detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the government is concerned about large cash transactions totaling over $10,000. The agency in charge of the reporting is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the United States Department of Treasury. FinCEN‚Äôs job is to collect and analyze financial reports they receive to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. On March 18, 2013 FinCEN issued a statement declaring any business that acts as an ‚Äòadministrator or exchanger‚Äô that accepts and transmits a virtual currency is a money transmitter. A money transmitter by FinCEN‚Äôs own definition is a person (or business) that provides a service that engages in a ‚Äòtransfer of funds‚Äô, or substitutes funds in another form to be transmitted or delivered from one person to another. Since FinCEN now declares businesses that buy/sell bitcoin as a money transmitter, it effectively groups businesses into what is referred to as a Money Services Business (MSB). MSB‚Äôs include money transmitters, check cashing, dealers in foreign currency exchange, or other money related instruments. All Money Services Businesses (MSB) are required by law to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). When the company registers, they opt-in to federal regulations under FinCEN. Regulations require the business to file a currency transaction report (CTR) for deposits or sales totaling over $10,000 from a single customer, or a suspicious activity report (SAR) if the transaction or customer appear to be suspicious in anyway. ‚ÄòStructuring‚Äò is a term used to describe arranging deposits/sales in manner that would avoid reporting and is considered suspicious. Also, regulations require the business to draft a written anti-money laundering (AML) policy. The drafted policy typically states how the business will review itself to make sure that its own policy is followed. For smaller businesses this usually involves hiring an accounting firm to perform an annual audit. These regulations and reporting requirements are why bitcoin exchanges place limits on customer transactions for a daily/weekly amount. Knowing the information above, we can now discuss risk. Banks try avoid risky businesses at all costs. Most of us in business also try to minimize risk, or at least our exposure to it, as mush as possible to remain profitable. Due to FinCEN and other financial regulations, banks tend to de-risk themselves whenever possible, which includes blanket account closures on certain account types they deem high risk. A major target for these wholesale termination policies are MSBs. Many banks, instead of updating their compliance procedures to manage higher risk accounts, simply choose to terminate them, or deny them an account instead. Typical reasons given by banks for denying businesses an account are a combination of the following: (See images included below for real-life examples from above) As you can see, most excuses issued from the banks revolve around risk and compliance. Banks simply apply their non-MSB policy or state compliance related problems as their excuse to not bank MSBs, which includes bitcoin related businesses. Some banks have detailed questionnaires and willingly accept some MSBs based on their bank policies. In the case of Huntington bank, question number 11 on their MSB questionnaire asks if the business deals with or exchanges bitcoin. Regardless of whether the account was denied because the business is ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù, conducted over 50% of business as MSB, or just bitcoin related in general, the bank still declined to open the business account. Believe it or not, this type of conduct is frown upon by FinCEN, the banks financial regulator. In an article released by FinCEN dated November 10, 2014 (available here), FinCEN states that they do not support the ‚Äúwholesale termination of MSB accounts without regard to the risks presented or the bank‚Äôs ability to manage the risk‚Äù. The article further states that MSB risk tolerance should be considered on an account-by-account basis. Banks are simply ignoring the aforementioned guidance from FinCEN in favor of de-risking accounts. Furthermore, FinCEN also states that ‚Äú[The bank] should understand the MSB‚Äôs business model and the general nature of the MSB‚Äôs own customer base, but it does not need to know the MSB‚Äôs individual customers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. This is no different from requirements applicable to any other business customer‚Äù. With all of the drama taking place trying to open a bitcoin related MSB account, you would assume somewhere in all the regulations that banks are required to follow, there would be a consumer protection regulation that protects your right to open a bank account against such unfair reasoning. Especially when we established above that the banks have even been issued guidance from regulators that opening these types of accounts is completely legal. Opening complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau didn‚Äôt make any of the banks I contacted reconsider their policy decisions. In fact, they plainly stated in writing the same excuses risk related excuses. In a letter received after filing a complaint with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Federal Reserve stated ‚Äúwe did not find that the bank violated the federal consumer protection laws and regulations under our purview when it denied your request for a business checking account‚Äù. After being denied by every bank and credit union in my local area and most of Pennsylvania, I proceeded to look for out of state banks to partner with. This is where things start to get even more complicated. Because you are banking in another state, (based on my experience) your business LLC likely needs a ‚Äúforeign entity‚Äù filing in the state you‚Äôre looking to bank in. Since my business already had a foreign entity filing and was able to business in Colorado, I started there. Unfortunately, most banks still outright declined to open a business account. Even some MSB friendly banks declined opening accounts based on the fact the business was bitcoin related. Some of you might be have some questions pertaining to banks in other states. Especially bitcoin ATM operators that handle cash. Obviously bitcoin businesses that handle bank ACH transfers and credit cards instead of cash have it a lot easier when banking out of state because everything is digital. However, cash operators have to make a cash deposit. This is where banking gets even more complicated than it already is. This is where commercial cash vaults come into play. From my understanding, the business would hire an armored truck company to pickup cash either from your office or serviced directly from your bitcoin machine, and make a deposit into a commercial cash vault. Supposedly once in a cash vault, its either delivered to your bank via a withdrawal from a cash vault near your bank, or its digitally added to your account once in the vault. This is how a long distance cash deposit is made into your bank that is located in another state. Just when you thought this situation could not get any worse, you will find that some armored trucks will deny you an account with their company because your business is bitcoin related. Both Brinks and Loomis armored trucks will deny you service. One cash carrier that will provide you with service is GardaWorld (garda.com). A support representative will usually forward you to a sales rep that already has experience setting up bitcoin related accounts. After searching the internet and investing many countless hours of research and chasing down leads, I was able to find a only a couple banks that are just semi-willing to entertain opening a bitcoin related MSB account. One is Silvergate Bank located in San Diego. Apparently Silvergate Bank is partnered with Xapo in some way, but will only open accounts for businesses that already have multiple millions of dollars in assets. Metropolitan Commercial Bank located in New York City, is somehow partnered with Coinbase, though this ended up being a dead end, with no emails returned. A talk with a lower level business account representative was mostly concerned about how many millions of dollars of assets my business had. Clearly not recommended for small business owners. Finally, Cross River Bank located in New Jersey. Cross River Bank is also somehow involved with Coinbase and is willing to work with bitcoin related exchanges and businesses. However, Cross River Bank will not bank bitcoin ATMs. In conclusion, business banking is a choke point for bitcoin startups. The inability to legally move US dollar from one place to another creates a massive burden on businesses. Coincidentally the problem being describing in this article is the exact reason for bitcoin‚Äôs existence. The free flow of value from one spot to another that is completely friction-less. When you download a bitcoin wallet you can‚Äôt be denied by the bitcoin network because of a ‚Äúrisk tolerance policy‚Äù or million dollar asset requirements. I was hoping to end this article on a positive note. However I am still in search of a bank that will open an account for my business and its single bitcoin ATM. The experience has weakened my view on the United States banking system, but strengthened my resolve on bitcoin. It has reminded me how truly powerful bitcoin actually is and the massive potential it has. As for fixing the choke point with banks, I‚Äôm not sure where to start. Regulations are likely political. We would need to elect officials that would either remove regulations or create more regulations to fix the problem. Maybe the banks could be sued? Maybe this falls under anti-trust laws? Could a large group of bitcoin companies start a bank or credit union that‚Äôs bitcoin friendly? Those are some things that came to mind while writing this article. Government is a slow moving bloated machine. So are banks. If any change is coming to these regulations or policies, its likely going to be very slow and in the distant future. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Crimes_Enforcement_Network https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/money-services-business-msb-information-center https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf (FinCEN Virtual Currency Money Transmitter Statement) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_services_business http://files.acams.org/pdfs/2016/Blanket-De-Risking-of-Money-Service.pdf https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/news_release/20141110.pdf This article is written by Zachary Owens.

And it‚Äôs poised to become a key part of our day-to-day, as common and as transformative as electricity. Perhaps the most interesting thing about AI is that, while it can automate and do ‚Äúwork‚Äù at greater efficiency, it uses machine learning to ‚Äúthink‚Äù and ‚Äúlearn‚Äù over time, strategizing, designing, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. If that sounds a lot like a human brain, it‚Äôs because deep learning, one of the most important methods of machine learning, is based on the idea of a neural network, modeling the structure and function of the human brain.

In 2019 this change is known as Artificial Intelligence. These two words have done a big impact on our vision towards technology. instead of going deep, I would like to give you a reflection of understanding what is Artificial intelligence in natural understanding, by saying natural understanding means the basic or layman‚Äôs understanding of this technology instead of going deep in its technical definition and facts. If we talk about our early‚Äôs day we only relate the term intelligence with human beings and animals in a biological manner, but today we are trying to give the same intelligence to our computer system even we got success in it up to some extent till now. Artificial intelligence makes our computer system capable to think, behave or to take decisions like the same way we humans do. you can understand artificial intelligence as an approach to make a replica of human intelligence or how humans think and make decisions for a particular action. we saying it artificial because this intelligence has been given by human through training and feeding of information from its environment.By saying our computer system intelligent we mean that they are smart enough to act for a given problem or we can say that our computer system is now capable to take decisions by its own without any external efforts. we can understand this by saying that the computer system can observe the given task or problem in the same way humans do. Today, AI becomes the most common factor which is responsible for Automating the thousands of daily tasks where human efforts are replaced by computer systems. Our computer systems now become intelligent and smart enough as they already know about our likes and dislikes, what we are going to search on the browser or what we are going to type in our mail they can predict and suggest us. whether we have to predict climate or share market, AI is good enough to do that.In medical science, AI is used to diagnose a disease like cancer by using predicting machine learning models. In shopping sites, AI suggests us the items we like. This is just a reflection of understanding about artificial intelligence, when we go deep there is speech recognition, text recognition, image recognition.There is Natural language processing(NLP), which gives the ability to understand the human language to the computer system, but I think we will now have a basic idea of AI and its scope. we can expand and understand AI in the next articles. -- -- Young and Passionate engineer, love to learn new technologies. currently working on data science and machine learning.

Luckily that's all we've done for the last thousand years. A key part of adapting is being able to have insightful introspection of our own limitations and strengths. If we trace our personal strategy without exploring the blind spots of our self perception, we are destined to hours of frustration and overwork. In my case, and of most humans, it's embracing our own mortality, acknowledging our existence bound to the temporal domain. And before you eject your seat after reading that last line, stay with me, this is less philosophical than it seems. I've always been extremely curious in nature. Coupled with a really wide spectrum of interests, it almost seems obvious to find myself asking: Why can't I find time for this? Proficiency takes time, mastery takes a lot of time. It's easy to get carried away in the drawing board perfecting your technique, but more often than not we are better off diving straight to the pool. Especially if there's someone crying for help from the deep end. Ok, but what does this have to do with technology? In short, everything. Staying up to date with technology is very time-consuming. You might find your self after months of harnessing a technology uncovering hundreds of articles and experts speculating its inevitable obsolescence.

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/amazons-bet-that-augmented-reality-will-increase-operational-efficiency-5f90ace1518b?source=tag_archive---------99-----------------------,Amazon‚Äôs Bet that Augmented Reality will Increase Operational Efficiency,The Convergence of AI & VR - What You Can Expect | Data Driven Investor,Mark Persaud,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mark Persaud Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Amazon recently published a patent that demonstrates augmented reality‚Äôs potential for solving business problems. The patent, ‚Äúaugmented reality assisted deliveries,‚Äù is for an application that relies on an AR headset to communicate to Amazon package delivery agents with the best times, routes, and parking locations, and more to facilitate speedy delivery of packages. The Business Problem Here‚Äôs the business problem, according to the patent: ‚ÄúExperienced delivery agents often learn information about the delivery routes and delivery areas that are not reflected in a delivery route generated by a routing application.‚Äù In other words, the delivery route doesn‚Äôt always contain crucial information that would help the agent do an efficient job, such as the best place to park in order to help an agent deliver and leave in the fastest way possible or where to leave the package when there‚Äôs not a doorman present. www.datadriveninvestor.com The Solution As reported in GeekWire, AR would help solve the problem as follows: ‚óè According to the patent, computer servers would keep track of where the agents are and where they are headed. ‚óè As agents make their rounds, useful delivery tips (such as ideal parking locations) inputted in a database by other drivers (based on their own experiences) would be routed to drivers via AR headsets. As noted in GeekWire, ‚ÄúYou could even have the location of the key box flash on and off as you‚Äôre looking at the entryway to an apartment building.‚Äù The patent itself contains far more detail on how the AR interface would work. My Take The Amazon patent demonstrates an essential truth about immersive realities such as augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality: immersive reality can achieve real breakthroughs by fueling business growth through the creation of lovable products/experiences centered on different user groups. Here we can identify two user groups: ‚óè Primary user group: delivery agents. ‚óè Secondary user group: end customers. In the example of the Amazon patent (a design, not quite a product just yet), Amazon seeks to use AR to support product delivery to customers to ensure their customers have a great end-to-end experience with the brand: browse, order, and deliver ‚Äî and we know efficient delivery is a key competitive advantage that brings customers back to Amazon. A solution like this could greatly affect the delivery agents in a positive way ‚Äî by minimizing the time it takes for them to re-route or figure out where the actual drop-off location is (think operational efficiency) without having to search a four-flat apartment in Chicago or lose time finding a coach house. Consider also, the potential impact on the secondary user group, end customers. They could receive packages with a more accurate estimate of the delivery time, and the drop-off location would be more consistent and reliable ‚Äî think customer satisfaction (and yes, I have found packages on my back patio and wondered why a business felt that my back patio was the optimal place to leave my package). The AR product could potentially provide a lovable solution for multiple user groups within the Amazon value chain: the company (Amazon), delivery agent, and consumer. I challenge other companies to think of ways that you can apply innovation to create a lovable product for multiple user groups across your business‚Äôs supply chain or product. The Big Picture As we look across some major retailers like Alibaba and Walmart, we see a considerably greater patent investment from Amazon and Alibaba. This finding leads us to believe these companies are working on new ways to connect brands and products to consumers and innovate on their overall value chain. However, knowing that these two global companies, in particular, have been known to expand and disrupt other industries, I don‚Äôt think it would be too big of a leap to see them venture out into something new using some revolutionary technology. In addition, the application demonstrates that we‚Äôve barely begun to apply technology to really change the supply chain. We recently blogged about how blockchain can make supply chain management a more sustainable process. The supply chain is ripe for innovation. In fact, supply chain can be a catalyst to change the global economy. Amazon is a perfect candidate to drive this change. The company has become a major delivery giant with its own self-contained ecosystem. It is a bellwether company that, like Walmart, uses its scale and muscle to effect change. Create Lovable Immersive Reality Experiences Tied to Business Outcomes Immersive reality is gaining ground fast in many industries from entertainment, AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction), to retail and many more. But many businesses are struggling to define use cases for immersive reality and to budget accordingly. At Moonshot, we understand these challenges. We have created specific activities to identify the right use case(s) and assist in the digital strategy road mapping that will help business decision-makers feel confident about innovating and bringing new product ideas to life.

Member-only story Nick Kolakowski Follow Dice Insights -- Share Digital assistants such as Amazon‚Äôs Alexa and Apple‚Äôs Siri are becoming more ubiquitous in the consumer space, but businesses remain a largely untapped (and tempting) target for the technology. Of course, most businesses simply don‚Äôt have a use case for a ‚Äúsmart speaker‚Äù or similar device that can play music on demand or answer simple questions about the weather.

https://medium.com/pgs-software/another-10-benefits-of-cloud-computing-f8e1cc38ff45?source=tag_archive---------179-----------------------,Another 10 Benefits Of Cloud Computing,Published in PGS Software,Pawe≈Ç ZajƒÖczkowski,No Author URL,N/A,10 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Pawe≈Ç ZajƒÖczkowski Follow PGS Software -- Listen Share Cloud computing has become the new normal. Numerous companies are starting their software projects directly in the Cloud, or are migrating existing ones there‚Ä¶ and with numerous good reasons. In my last post, I explained 10 of the biggest benefits behind Cloud Computing. However, I also quickly realised that 10 advantages weren‚Äôt enough ‚Äî there‚Äôs more to talk about! So, here‚Äôs the second and final part. Between this and the first entry, that‚Äôs 20 key benefits for Cloud solutions! In the first part, we had a short introduction covering types of hosting and Cloud service levels. Then, we dived into 10 advantages of Cloud computing. If you want a quick recap, this included: In this part, we will cover 10 further benefits, as well as demystify commonly misunderstood problems with the Cloud. I hope doing so will leave you much more informed about the Cloud‚Äôs advantages and why so many businesses are choosing to adopt, migrate and thrive. Many companies are tied to gargantuan database management systems or enterprise servers, complete with tons of features they don‚Äôt really use, but pay tons of money for nonetheless. Cloud providers offer several alternatives that turn out to be much cheaper. There are plenty of useful tools that can help us in migrating a database from an existing vendor to a Cloud equivalent that‚Äôs more than adequate. The second option is to stay with the old vendor but, instead of hosting it ourselves, pick it up as a managed service from the Cloud provider. The economy of scale principle applies here as well ‚Äî the Cloud provider can purchase a license for specific databases at a much cheaper per rate processing core than most companies ‚Äî once again sharing the savings with us by offering it as a service. A Cloud provider‚Äôs core business is selling computing resources, not to rip us off on software. In cases where there is no Cloud equivalent or managed version of the software we need, and the licensing is bound to a particular physical machine, it‚Äôs not a problem either. We can select the appropriate tenancy level of machines in the Cloud, ensuring we adhere to such license requirements. Security is a very important factor for IT systems, especially as the amount and variety of personal information we store within increase constantly. One might say that handing over the data to someone else is a risk, but usually, the opposite is true. Cloud vendors maintain a very high standard when it comes to both the physical and virtual safety of their data centres. Once again, because of scale, they can do so more efficiently than most companies will ever be able to. These vendors can afford scrutinized third-party audits and the employment of top-notch security experts. Such staff also can‚Äôt just peak into our data, as we are the ones holding SSH keys to virtual machines. There is also support for sophisticated cryptographic schemes for many services, including encrypting everything under several layers of rotating keys, where the master key can be kept in tamper-proof hardware or may never even be present in the Cloud. Paranoid as it may be, if we are afraid of running containers or virtual machines on a physical machine shared with someone else, we may choose a tenancy level to have them for us exclusively. If you are hesitant to trust Cloud providers, keep in mind that the US Government, as well as numerous major banks, are running their IT systems there. These organisations requires a different level of trust than holding information about which cat image you liked or commented on. Aside from security, IT systems further need to comply with various regulation on how to store, as well as process, personal and sensitive information. Many industries are loosely regulated, but if we are dealing with medical, financial or government data, we need to be prepared to meet certain laws. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US, GDPR in Europe or numerous ISO certifications. Getting such certifications for in-house infrastructure is costly, problematic and time-consuming. However, major Cloud vendors already hold a portfolio of such standards, so we can free ourselves from thinking about them on the infrastructure level. Some regulation might require us to keep data in certain countries, which is easier to achieve with the number of different regions and availability zones Cloud providers offer. If we were to do that ourselves, all our problems related to maintaining hardware would only multiply. The Cloud offers much more than raw computing power, memory, and storage. For example, we now have: The list could go on, but you can see just how versatile it is. Sure, we can use many of those from outside of the Cloud but, if we already have some systems in there, we gain a number of key benefits. For example, we gain a diversity of entry points we can attach to events related to our other services. Common interfaces make it easier to integrate with other services and resources. We also have centralized control over what is going on in the entire system without constantly switching between various consoles or tools. Costs become transparent and easy to track. Using existing building block from one common sandbox is more convenient than jumping between sandboxes or building the actual blocks from the ground up ourselves. What if a block is missing, or the one we have is not meeting our requirements? Well, we can always leave our sandbox and look somewhere else ‚Äî but let it be a choice, not a necessity. Having a vast number of datacentres available for us to deploy our systems to has several advantages. We gain availability and disaster recovery capabilities, which we have already mentioned, but that‚Äôs not all. We can also fulfil certain regulations related to the physical geographic location of our data, as we discussed as part of the Cloud‚Äôs compliance benefits, and we can also be closer to our users. But, hey ‚Äî everyone is on the Internet, so aren‚Äôt we global after all? We are, but we could be more global. Packet latency between Europe and Australia is noticeable and, if we want to minimize the responsiveness of our systems, we would prefer that our user in New Zealand to talk to servers in Sydney, instead of Frankfurt. Major Cloud providers have datacentres all around the globe and they are constantly adding new ones. By having our system distributed across many farms and using geographical load balancing, we can assure the best possible experience for our users. Leveraging a massive content delivery network on the Cloud gives us opportunity enhance the experience even more. With all the savings, performance and optimizations of the economy of scale comes the benefit of ecology. The Cloud provider ecosystem, combined with all its clients and partners, will consume less electricity and produce less pollution than if everyone would operate on their own. This includes day to day operations, but also the environmental burden of producing all the hardware in the first place. Google Cloud, for instance, claims that they consume 50% less energy than typical datacentres and that they purchase from renewable sources. Even if somebody doesn‚Äôt really care about our planet, there is always the factor of keeping good public relations at stake. Finding good specialists in the software industry is not an easy task. People like to work with modern technologies and learn new things. On the other side of this, they hate to work with obsolete technologies. Cloud is the new normal and traditional hosting is an increasing burden, not only for administrators and infrastructure people, but also for software developers. They may be more likely to join our organisation ‚Äî and stay with us ‚Äî if we can offer them the possibility to immerse themselves with Cloud technologies. Cloud vendors create a network of partners around their ecosystems. Among others, there are consulting companies and software houses that employ people specialised in building Cloud-native applications, as well as migrating legacy systems into the Cloud. Basically, any business needs software now, and any serious business needs something custom-built to their specifications. Software houses are constantly looking for new customers. A partner network is a place where these those two can find each other and start collaborating. Businesses gain a proven software vendor and can additionally benefit from Cloud discounts the vendors have. The vendor, likewise, gets a client for its software and the Cloud provider finds a client for its services. Everyone wins. Cloud flexibility speeds us up in any situation where hardware management in classic hosting paradigms becomes a limiting factor. For instance: All those endeavours have a common denominator: time. We can make things happen faster, thus gaining an edge over any competition that uses traditional hosting model. Furthermore, times equal not only money, but sometimes survival in today‚Äôs mercilessly shifting business landscape. We all want to succeed and we do our best to achieve that. Yet, nevertheless, sometimes we fail. Perhaps the business plan wasn‚Äôt that good after all, maybe the competition was faster or perhaps they simply had a better product. Maybe we underestimated the required effort, or we failed to find an investor for the crucial round of funding. Maybe the technology choices in our project were wrong or we couldn‚Äôt find enough developers in time. Perhaps, just maybe, we were simply out of luck. Whatever the cause, imagine that we need to abandon the idea and start with a new one. If our servers are running in the Cloud, we can simply flip the switch and get rid of all our infrastructure. With the classic hosting model, we are left with tons of bare metal we need sell to recover at least some of the money we invested in it. So, there you go: 20 benefits for using the Cloud. While I don‚Äôt have any more advantages to talk about (at least not right now)‚Ä¶ how about I debunk a couple of so-called disadvantages? A commonly mentioned disadvantage of using the Cloud is vendor lock-in. What happens if our Cloud-provider goes out of business, raises prices or does something else which makes cooperation no longer possible? First of all, it is unlikely to happen. Secondly, we have layers of abstraction we can put on vendor-specific services, as well as tools that allow us to lift and shift most of our infrastructure to a different Cloud vendor. Thirdly, we may choose to substitute most vendor-managed services with software we configure and run on our own, whether it‚Äôs in containers on virtual machines. Another classically misaligned disadvantage of Cloud computing is the lack of control over our infrastructure. We might be tricked into thinking that, if the servers are not physically in our basement, then we are depending on a third party and we will be in trouble. What we need to realise is that we already do depend on a myriad of third parties. There are hardware producers, internet service providers, electrical and water suppliers, not to mention the layers of software and operating systems, such as hypervisors, container engines, interpreters, frameworks, devices firmware, and so on. These all have their own dependencies, and you will find that their dependencies have further dependencies of their own. We live in a deeply integrated and interconnected world and we cannot just do things on our own, because it‚Äôs simply infeasible. We should treat Cloud computing as a normal service that someone else provides for money. There are no silver bullets and the Cloud is no exception to this. There are some cases where the traditional hosting model might be better for an enterprise, but they are very rare and, most likely, they are candidates for a hybrid Cloud solution, where only a small part of the infrastructure is kept on-premise, while most of it operates in the Cloud. For the vast majority of companies starting digital projects in the Cloud, or migrating existing ones, this is a no-brainer in the current state of the software industry. The Cloud services landscape is evolving rapidly. Major Cloud vendors are adding new functionalities on daily basis and the competition is fierce, which is to the benefit of companies that already use the Cloud, or are planning to migrate their software inventory. Properly used, the Cloud helps with flexibility, scalability, fault-tolerance, security, performance, and many other aspects of modern IT systems, while unlocking unparalleled technical and, as a result, business possibilities. The Cloud offers all of this at our fingertips. Our Cloud adoption workshop can help you on your journey to Cloud computing and all the benefits and opportunities that come with it.

Basechain is Loom Network‚Äôs mainnet. It is interoperable with all major blockchains, optimized for highly-scalable user-facing dapps, and enables secure asset transfers between chains. Blockchains are no joke. The codebase is often complex, and a lot is at stake (no pun intended üòú). Public blockchains are designed to be decentralized ‚Äî meaning there is no central authority that can censor transactions. However, this also means there is no central authority you can appeal to in case of fraudulent transactions or hacks. Hence, ensuring the security of a blockchain is paramount. And since we take security so seriously here at Loom, we made sure to have a proper security audit done by a reliable third party. Trail of Bits is an information security company founded in 2012 by industry leaders Dan Guido, Dino Dai Zovi, and Alexander Sotirov. Some of their notable clients include Western Digital, Facebook, and DARPA. In the blockchain industry, they‚Äôve done security audits for Parity, Gemini, and Tendermint, among many others. We wanted the best security experts to test our code, and based on their track record, we hired Trail of Bits for the audit. The Basechain security audit was done from April 1 to May 3 of 2019. The auditors did a manual code review of the loom binary, the Ethereum mainnet smart contracts that make up the Transfer Gateway, and the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) system, and further tested the code as following: All issues uncovered in the audit have been acknowledged, fixed, and tested thoroughly, and additional security enhancements have been implemented ‚Äî making Basechain more secure than ever. And to maintain this high level of blockchain security, we plan on having regular third-party security audits performed in the future. Now that we‚Äôve ensured the security of Basechain, we‚Äôve made the code open source. This is an important step toward making the chain a fully decentralized network. You can view the code on our GitHub. Loom Network is the multichain interop platform for scaling high-performance dapps ‚Äî already live in production, audited, and battle-tested.

To quote Surreal and the Sound Providers: Its been a long journey, a hard roadFilled with potholes and obstaclesI‚Äôve fallen so many times It forged character though, and growth in my rhymes While I don‚Äôt spend my days penning verses or rhymes I can relate. There have been lots of ups and downs and I learned a lot in the last two and half years mostly by stumbling through it. With that in mind, I wrote this letter that I wish I had years ago when I started my journey into corporate. Since though I can‚Äôt go back in time‚Ä¶yet, I write this letter to you, dear reader. A letter to me, but written for you in the hope that you will learn from my mistakes and glean whatever wisdom is present. Dear Younger Self, You did it! You finally got your foot in the door and landed the corporate UX job. You‚Äôre in the big leagues now. Its taken you a few years to get here and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears but its worth it. All the unanswered networking emails and the questions their silence raises can rest for now. You don‚Äôt have to ask yourself if you will one day be a professional designer. Today is that day and you are now and forever more a designer. So on this momentous occasion it seems appropriate for me to bestow on you advice that will make this next chapter a little easier. The first piece of advice I have for you is‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt take it personally This chapter will bring some really great opportunities but along the way you are going to run into some really tough cookies. They are going to say things that hurt, that cut you deep and they will accuse you of all sorts of grievances and trespasses. Don‚Äôt take it personally. They are likely operating out of a place of fear and don‚Äôt have nearly the same support network that you do. You can learn to engage in some tactical empathy and push through it. Some of them just need an ally, others could use some space. They have their own struggles you don‚Äôt see because‚Ä¶ You aren‚Äôt the center of the universe You aren‚Äôt even the center of the solar system and there is infinitely more going on than you realize. Zoom out for a minute and gain some perspective on people and their circumstances. It isn‚Äôt about you. People have their own struggles and agendas in the corporate world and to navigate them you have to learn to see things from another perspective. Try and keep that in mind to prevent sticking your foot in your mouth. This is a difficult skill and it takes practice but it will be significantly easier if you‚Ä¶ Find your people The corporate office is can be a big and scary place. You‚Äôre new to the game and you are going to need to lean on the wisdom of others. You will need allies who can help you manage the complexity but more than that you are going to need to find your people. Go find the crazy ones. The ones who will listen to your ideas and dreams without scoffing. The people who have been where you are and have stood tall. It isn‚Äôt always going to be smooth sailing and when the storms come you need to have people you can rely on. When you find these people stay close and listen up. They are smarter than you realize and they will take some serious hits on your behalf along the way. Stick together, have their back and‚Ä¶ Never ever say anything negative about anyone You aren‚Äôt as helpful as you think and are capable of more harm than you realize. When you have the opportunity to speak your mind about someone else just shut up. UX especially in your sphere is going to be an uphil battle and plenty of people are going to have a lot to say about the people they work with. DO NOT ENGAGE. Your words and actions will leave lasting scars on your relationships that may never fully heal. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND WALK AWAY. All that being said though‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt fear failure There will be many times in the next years that you feel afraid. Afraid to fail. Afraid to succeed. Afraid to give up and afraid to continue. That‚Äôs okay. Be brave and take risks. There will be plenty of time for safety but when you see the opportunities come up you have to take them. You won‚Äôt always feel equipped to make the leap required but you have to go for it. Put time on the new executive‚Äôs calendar, ask to present your work, go sell the heck out of that architecture diagram. You‚Äôre going to do great. If you shoot for the moon and miss you don‚Äôt fall among the stars, nor do you burn-up on reentry. In fact, you find you had more fuel than you knew and the adventure has just begun. This is a big step but it is only a single step. You have more to do and see and there is a whole world out there waiting to be experienced. This isn‚Äôt the end of your journey but the next beginning. Get ready for launch. Keep dreaming.

You know the one. It has lingered for years, hanging out at the bottom of your priority list, waiting for that mythical time when you can turn your attention to it. It‚Äôs likely an overwhelming problem too. It may have started out small and inconsequential, but it has gotten steadily worse over the years. Maybe you inexplicably use five different CRM systems across five different departments, none of which talk to each other (we mean the CRM platforms don‚Äôt talk, although maybe also the departments). Maybe your employee database is horribly out-of-date and untrustworthy. Maybe your mission-critical documents are a jumbled mess that only one person on the compliance team can navigate. Whatever the horrible business skeleton you‚Äôve been ignoring, it will be an ordeal to tackle at this point. It will take a force of nature just to get the right people in the room for the first meeting. Then it will be an endless battle to get some of their time they‚Äôve already promised to competing priorities and to-do lists. So yeah, outdated databases, messy document systems, simple tasks that require multiple applications, and other faulty processes aren‚Äôt ideal. But as long as a problem doesn‚Äôt bring business to a halt, it doesn‚Äôt demand your immediate attention. The issue is, problems like this are insidious. Outdated, inefficient, messy processes become ingrained in everyday business operations. Eventually, we might even resign ourselves to accepting that the issue can never be fixed. Don‚Äôt despair quite yet. You can address process problems when improving your digital products. Starting a new UX project can be one of the best times to tackle long-ignored business problems head on. Reexamining your digital products can shed light on festering internal issues and help you determine a unifying solution for them. In fact, UX projects sometimes require that you address an internal problem when it impacts your product‚Äôs overall user experience. Often, the issues users have with your site or app directly correlate with an internal process shortcoming. When your customers struggle to find documents in your outdated, hodge-podge document management system or beg for a reliable way to find someone to contact, the negative effect on your business and online reputation demands you take care of the issue. Internal processes and good user experience are often two sides of the same coin. It can be tempting to ignore these internal process issues that raise their ugly heads in the midst of new site, application, or software suite development. After all, you already have a lot going on in the middle of a digital product redesign. Addressing additional business issues can increase project time lines, cause extra headaches, and strain relationships with people in other departments. But the truth is, as long as any business problems related to your new site or app go unaddressed, it doesn‚Äôt matter how great the rest of your UX is. Your new digital product will be limited and diminished. And of course, that process remains a thorn in your side. Here‚Äôs the good news: Armed with an official project, official team, official deadline, and official backing from your organization, getting other departments and stakeholders together to work on the problem can be much easier. Instead of begging your peers for more time and effort, you can use the user experience project itself to drive discussions and solutions to business problems. That‚Äôs because now your colleagues have skin in the game on a project that‚Äôs going to happen with or without their help. They‚Äôll be much more likely to make time for it because they won‚Äôt want the new site or app to launch without their input. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will all be smooth sailing. You‚Äôll still have to go through the planning, meetings, reminder emails, check-ins, feedback, tough conversations, back-and-forths, and all the other hurdles that come when disparate departments work together. But an ongoing UX project that relies on smooth business processes and user satisfaction will help start conversations. In turn, those conversations will lead to better UX decisions. When business processes that affect your digital product work better, you‚Äôll create a more successful digital product and get better return on your UX investment. You can simultaneously fix poor business processes and develop or redesign a digital product that customers will love using. When you cross a long-lingering internal problem off your to-do list, the resulting improvements will empower your new or existing product. And, as if that alone wouldn‚Äôt be worth the effort, getting rid of old, slow-going processes will lead to better internal efficiency and give your team time to tackle the other, greater business projects. It will take time. It will take work. It will take some grit and nagging. But if you‚Äôre relentless about improving internal tools and processes that impact user experience, you can also create powerful, future-proof, usable digital products that enhance other business operations. The long-lasting business benefits will be well, well worth it. ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî Our team has been doing the real work of user experience since the earliest days of the commercial web. We‚Äôre out to make your digital products a whole lot better.

But for those who already have a Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or potentially even an Apple HomePod device in the house ‚Äî this goes up drastically to nearly 80%. That means that if you own a smart speaker you‚Äôre far more likely to use your voice operated personal assistant such as Siri or Google Assistant on your phone went out and about, in the car, or any other place you might have your smartphone on you. For those of us that are creating experiences for smart speakers this means we should really be thinking about all the different contexts that someone might use a voice operated personal assistant in their daily life. Over 50% of people who own a smart speaker now owning more than one. If you‚Äôve already got someone using your skill or action, but haven‚Äôt yet actually managed to make it work on a mobile device, (and in most cases this is going to be on Google Assistant), this could be a really strong way of driving further adoption of your experience, or potentially opening up whole new avenues of engagement with your consumer. -- -- News and perspectives from the Vixen Labs team.
